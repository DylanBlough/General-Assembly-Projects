I'm not here to get into why she did what she did. Technically speaking, as far as her guilt is concerned, it doesn't matter. This post is to point out that the media was used to sell a false narrative to the public that none of these standards exist to protect such data and that she was not personally subject to them despite being the acting secretary of state.  
example:  [https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-told-fbi-she-thought-classified-markings-were-alphabetical-paragraphs](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-told-fbi-she-thought-classified-markings-were-alphabetical-paragraphs) 

After Clinton's crimes were made public, the subsequent cover up and trial-by-media had to be orchestrated from the top down to thwart the legal process already in place on both civilian and military fronts. Doing so undermined the integrity of the entire classified information program to anyone who uses it. Or perhaps it exposed how truly precarious a system is that blindly punishes or absolves defendants based on secret merit and by secret officiators? Regardless, Clinton's espionage was reduced to a partisan issue in order to baffle the public. It was never a partisan issue.",conspiracy,Hillary Clintons guilt demystified

8,5nordehacedod,ew6zs7,"This was posted over at r/China_Flu.  I am only pushing this information for you to see this.  This is not mine.

 This  video is shot be Chen Qiushi. He is a famous ""citizen journalist"". He  went to Wuhan before the city was locked down. He uploaded lots of  videos to report first hand what is happening in Wuhan. This is his  latest video and he is scared!!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXozpbomAns&amp;t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXozpbomAns&amp;t=2s)

The video is in Chinese, does anyone know how to add English cc?

 

This  video is reporting on what he saw on 29th January, it's long and less  constructive than his usual videos, and is more of a rant, I broke it  down into several points below:

1. Censorship

He  acknowledge that he's now being censored on weibo. Apparently just  saying the initials of his names or a picture of him is enough to get  you banned. He said that his new weibo account got banned again. He also  said this video is longer than his usual 5 mins video because those are  intented to be shared on wechat, but now its pointless because wechat  censored him.

2) Medical supplies

The  medical supplies situation is horrible, the hospitals received packages  of all sizes from all over the country. He mentioned that small  packages is probably more a bothersome than help because all the  hospitals need to assign people to unpack them, then organise the  supplies into different categories.

3) Hospitals

The  hospitals have less people compared to the days before. He said this is  more likely to be caused by the lack of transport in the city and that  most people are being self-quarantine at home. He followed someone who's  suspected to caught the virus for a day, they went to 5 to 6 hospitals,  and the situations is too chaos, and the queue to getting tests is  still very long. The person he follows talked to a doctor, who had an  argument with them that they need to show proper reports to get  diagnosed because of the lack of test kits. Despite that, the hospitals  are still mostly in order, and the doctors, nurses, security guards are  being as polite as they can. One of the hospital he went to have beds on  the hallways, in front of the toilet, everywhere. And 70% of the people  there are on oxygen supplementation. There's also someone he talked to  that said the people in the hospitals are being dispensed because the  premier of China, Li Keqiang is coming to visit them. **In  the hospital, he saw a woman holding up someone who's siting on a  wheelchair, and the person on wheelchair has no mask on, the woman said  he's already dead and they are waiting for the transport to come get  him. (He showed the footage for this)**

4) The constructions of the field hospitals

The  construction workers are pushing themselves to the extreme to build the  hospitals. A guy he interviewed said he only slept 2-3 hours everyday  in the past 3 days. There's multiple construction firms working on it at  the same time, and he thinks that might be a problem because of the  high quality requirement for the hospitals. He also answered the  question of some people had about why not just turn existing  hotels/apartments into hospitals: A proper quarantine hospitals are  divided into three areas: green/yellow/red. With the reds being  diagnosed and severe, and green being suspected cases. The red area  requires air tight rooms to prevent air with virus from going outside,  and proper water treatment equipment for the same reason. Which isn't  possible in normal hotels.

5) The news

He  said that the Chinese media does reports the situation, however, all of  the reporters are in full isolation gowns, and they are doing  interviews through phones, and they also only does interviews in the  green area (see the previous paragraph). Because he had no proper  training, he had to try and find some investigate journalist on twitter  to get some tips on how to do proper reporting, and he touch on how rare  it is to find those in China. He also said that he saw on the news that  a reporter from a Hong Kong media is in the city too, so he did all he  could to find that person's wechat, but the HK reporter said that he  didn't left his hotel in the past few days, because the company he works  for don't want their employees to take that risk. That's when he  realise he's truly alone in this.

6) Japanese people in Wuhan

He  briefly touched on that he knows a couple people from the Japanese  embassy, they helped him get to Japan in the past. He called them and  wanted to ask about the people who are going back to Japan, but the  embassy said they couldn't help him. He said he haven't read the news  yet, but it's very important to know that how many people among these  200 are infected.

7) On himself

He  said he's starting to freak out, because the situation does seems  pretty dire. He repeats several times in the video that he only reports  on either what he see directly, or from direct sources like the families  of the infected. And he said while the situation has put a lot of  pressure on him, especially since he has been reporting in hospitals for  the past few days with just goggles, face masks and his coat that he  disinfect regularly, he will try his back get back on his feet. And as  long as he's alive, he will keep reporting the truth. He said both the  Justice Bureau and the police called him to look for him. They also  contacted his parents. He admits that while he's afraid, as he's stuck  between the virus and the criminal justice system of China, he'll say  this: ""FUCK YOU! I'm not even afraid of death! Why do you think I'm  afraid of the Communist Party?!""

 

One point I forgot: the transport

He  mentioned that since all private transportation are stopped, taxis  became the main transportation in the city. Each streets in Wuhan has 4  taxis assigned to it, however he says that that number is not even close  to being enough because of the amount of people living on one street is  like tens of thousands. He also said that he was added into a taxi  driver chat group, and the taxi drivers know about the virus since mid  to late December, some of them stopped shopping at that wet market  completely because of this. And he also said that lack of transport  might be one of the reason that less people are going to the hospital",conspiracy,Firsthand video from Wuhan from Chinese Journlaist  China Coverup Coronavirus

We’ve all seen it. Be it YouTube, Facebook, even here on reddit.  

It seems more than ever all the low tier preroll adds you see are vastly adds for mobile games that look like utter trash.

They all advertise through one of a few themes. It’s either poor acting of people playing the game,  the “how to loot” puzzle game add, or just blatant false advertising of gameplay.

I understand that the AppStore and mobile games are pretty much solely supported by whales, or just a general small section of the user base that buys into MTXs.

But some of these games are just straight up dog doo, and are so obviously  riddled with pay to win/advance/speed up tactic that there’s no reason to play the game without spending money.  And while I do believe that there are valid players using these games and potentially buying into MTXs. To support all the add space these apps occupy has to cost a good amount of money. 

** So here’s the take.**

These games, at least a few of them, must be used as some form of digital money laundering.  There’s just no want they have the popularity to support all these adds and take up so much of my timeline. 

To me it makes sense, there are so many ways that money is stolen digitally, taking that money and validating it has to be filtered in some way to get it clean and what better way that payrolling some shitty app developer to generate a stolen asset AppStore game. Then you just spoof user data set up boys and start buying into the game.

Africa, however, did not care well. By 2022, over a million people across 48 African countries died after being infected with the Wuhan Virus, with more than 3 million being infected in total. The rapid spread of the virus and high mortality rate in Africa was purely down to poverty, lack of healthcare and poor containment.

- Amongst the tens of thousands of existing wet markets in China, the virus started in the market close to Wuhan Institute of Virology, China’s most advanced virus research laboratory (what a coincidence!)

- China decided to quarantine Wuhan when there were “only” around 500 infected and 17 deaths.
From [this](https://www.google.fr/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/01/26/health/quarantine-china-coronavirus/index.html) CNN article:
The shutdown of Wuhan is ""utterly incredible,"" Howard Markel, professor and director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan, told CNN. “I've never seen an entire city 11.4 million people cordoned off like that,"" Markel said. ""I thought I'd seen everything.""
Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization's Center on Global Health Law, said the move was ""unprecedented,"" and, he thought, ""very unwise"". ""Nothing on this scale has ever been tried,"" he told CNN. 

- So in a country where 24000 people die every day, 4400 only from pollution, they quarantine 60 million people for just a flu with 17 deaths?

What reason could they have?
- (The only) One possible explanation is that they knew something else.
- And the (only) most plausible reason for them to know the seriousness of it is that the virus “escaped” from the lab (maybe an infected worker or animal?) and the lab informed the government about the seriousness of the virus  and the need for quarantine.

Chapter 19: The Light

January 30, 2020

My writing adventures are almost over! I can't wait until I finish because most of the feedback that I receive is abuse. After I finish a chapter, I advertise it publicly. And this always results in receiving a great deal of abuse from idiots who don't even read the entire chapter. The majority of the time they respond exactly how I say that they are going to respond in the chapter. People's evil actions against me always verifies my findings. But I am not for them. I am for the few. I don't care if 99% of what I receive is abuse. Because I am only for the 1%. But it takes great character to not take their insults to heart. In fact, if people respond in a hurtful way towards me, then they are immediately reaped and blocked.

But the scope of reaping souls extends far beyond that. To begin with, I do not need to tell the individuals that I reaped their souls. I just do that for show. It happens automatically. But the reaps don't only occur when people are rude to me. I have successfully reaped a soul when they read or watch my content and don't take its information to heart. All they have to do is read a few sentences and if they could care less about the vital information it carries, that is a successful reap. I intentionally put my material out there to reap the souls of those who possess no heart. For heart is the only thing that can save this planet. And we need to remove the souls from this world that have no heart. Reaping souls is a very real thing. For God sees all and God sees my reaps and the reasoning behind those reaps. People are stupid for not putting one and one together. It is their own damn fault and will result in their eternal damnation.

I am tired of constantly getting banned from places. My content is not welcome anywhere I go. Most communities will remove me from theirs. This is so annoying. I can't get my work out there because this world will not let me. After posting my final chapter I will be so relieved! It will mean the end of the constant abuse that I receive from the public because I will no longer be promoting my work. In the future, they will come to me and not I them. Posting my chapters on a public forum opens me up to abuse. The end is nigh! I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. One day I will be respected as an individual and not treated like trash on a regular basis. I look forward to that day where I no longer have to put up with the constant abuse. I have been receiving it since 2012. That will end in 2020.

The general public refuses to acknowledge me as a philosopher despite that being my major at university. The general public refuses to acknowledge me as a filmmaker, yet I have released countless films. The general public refuses to acknowledge me as an author even though I have written five books. How intelligent is the general public? How much sense does the general public make? Do not trust the collective for they execute prophets. There is no godliness in the opinions of the many. Question all social axioms as they are usually propoganda tools and are usually highly inaccurate. Do not allow the collective to take over your mind. Reject all mainstream celebrities. Stop watching their television. Avoid their employment system if you can. Don't get caught up in feeding the capitalistic system: live as a minimalist and don't focus your life around money. Do not immerse yourself in watching sports, for that practice encourages idolatry, gambling, unhealthy competition, and monotony. Try your best to avoid advertisements when you can, for they work on your subconscious. Avoid friendships that do not share your enthusiasm for virtue. It is better to be alone like I am than to have friends who bring you down as a result of their character. Those we spend most of our time around we become like. If you want to be a unique individual, spend a lot of time alone. Time alone is also excellent for inspiration. Spending a lot of time alone will shape you into your true self. Spending time with the wicked will rub wickedness off onto you. Be very careful about the experiences in which you choose in life. For they will shape your character.

Do not be afraid of death. Stand up to all forms of oppression. Put your life on the line without question when combatting those who are sinful.   Living in fear will turn you away from God. I am not scared of anyone or anything. I have faced all of my fears and now I have none. I am never frightened of standing up for what is right even when this lands me in prison. I am not afraid of the police who spend their days harrassing the virtuous. I don't care if someone has a gun, even when it is pointed at me. Go ahead and kill me. Let's see those results. I am not afraid of being robbed on the street. I would tell them to fuck off or kill me. They are getting my possessions over my dead body. This mentality is liberating. You will die whenever it is your time. This does not mean that you should provoke death. Allow what happens to happen and refuse to take any abuse despite who they are or what they want from you. Treat everyone impartially. Listen to what they want and if it invades your autonomy then stand up for yourself. I am not condoning violence. But I am advising you to not let others push you around.

In my childhood I learned a very important lesson that I will never forget. We always choose where we are. If you become uncomfortable somewhere, leave. It matters not if you get stuck somewhere or miss a ride home. What matters is that you are safe from the people that are hurting you. You can always walk away from any situation. It matters not what situation you are in or where you are. You can always find your way back home. Or you can always leave home. We always have choices and oftentimes just walking away from the situation is the best option. Do not allow others to make you feel like you are trapped. You never have to do anything that you don't want to. You never have to be somewhere that you don't want to be. Liberate your mind by liberating yourself from the enslavement of others. Do not endure hardship just to please another who is treating you poorly. Remember that you always choose where you are and this will avoid you much pain. I have gotten out of the car on a busy highway very far from my house before and then I spent the entire day walking home. I have walked away from fake friends who tried to force me to sin. Blackmail does not work on people like us. Neither does bribery. There is nothing another can do to corrupt me. Protect your heart with your life, for it is more valuable than your life. Don't let others blacken your heart, for that will have eternal consequences. Become like the wind and wend. Do not value the material but instead the spiritual.

I have spent my entire life outside of society looking down upon it and analysing it for clues as to why things are so bad. Something I have noticed is that society drives people away from one another. It is really difficult now days to find a friend who you trust. Divorce rates are half and most couples I see are unhappy with each other and their lives. People are unhappy everywhere I go. I am always happy and I want to share my happiness with others. I found the key to happiness in life and I made enough copies for everyone. I am disappointed by how miserable people are in this world and this causes me to work very hard to help others see the light. I know that I am controversial but I can't wake you up until I slap you out of your slumber. Despite what I have said throughout my work, I deeply care for people and want to see the best for them in life. Why else would I expend so much effort to bring this material to you, especially when I am constantly abused for it? I am trying my best to save the world and as a result the individuals within the world. But I can't do it without you. Please help me save the world.

And that is exactly what my work is: a solid attempt to save the world. Imagine if a lot of people spent their lives trying to save the world. Suddenly, delusions of grandeur become a reality. What I am unable to do alone we can do together. But our objective must be clear and not watered down. The objective is to save the world. We must not let this objective go despite what labels the doctors place upon us. The doctors are the ones who are insane by incarcerating and torturing those who spend their lives trying to save the world. Why would anyone try to save the world when fake doctors are punishing them for doing so? This practice discourages people from attempting to save the world because apparently that is a mental illness. Be very sceptical of everything mainstream society tells you. For most of it was created with a devious agenda behind it. The social elite are trying to send everybody to Hell by encouraging wicked practices within society and discouraging acts of virtue. Those on the top doing this to you are spiritual people. They are not atheists or agnostics. In fact, they are Satan worshippers. I have studied a great deal into the occult. They are controlling and directing this world. And their greatest weapon is sexual immorality.

Sexual immorality directly results in wicked people and the occult know this. So they structure their media to encourage this behaviour, normalising it to such an extent that now days it is unheard of to be a virgin until your marriage. They might not yet openly encourage polygamy but they do openly encourage promiscuous behaviour, moving from partner to partner, trying out their sexual organs like they were on display at a store. I have had two sexual partners in my life and I regret both of them. One was my ex-wife who left me. The other was my ex-fiance who also left me. I only ever wanted one sexual partner in my life but I failed at that because these women did not appreciate how obsessed I was with virtue. I failed and this was my fault. I should have waited for the perfect match. Instead, I worked with what was available. I did not see the perfect match anywhere so I settled. Do not settle in a relationship. Find your soul mate or be alone. Jumping from sexual partner to sexual partner will corrupt your soul. For when love is reduced to mere infatuation and sexual satisfaction, the meaning of love is lost. Those who have had many sexual partners have no ability to love. They are merely saying words that they understand nothing of. To truly love another one must love their soul. If one does not believe in souls then love is not a possibility for that person. If one does not love themselves then they can never love another.

Most people in this world hate themselves. This is because they live selfish lives and it is not possible to be happy when invested in this type of lifestyle. The only way to obtain true happiness in life is to give your life over to the public. A life wasted is a life entirely invested in themselves and no one else. Do not fool yourself into thinking that selfish desires like having a family or working in an employment system is a compassionate cause. Helping your friends when they are in need is also not a compassionate cause. Most activities in life in which we collectively consider compassionate causes are not. Even most charities are operated by the rich and as a result are structured to get the rich richer and the poor poorer. There are so many activities in this world that are disguised to appear as if they are a compassionate cause when in fact they are hurting our society. This is why you must be careful of who you donate to. For you will be held responsible for your actions if you make the world a worse place by investing in a ""compassionate"" cause. In order to truly love yourself you need to have a clear conscience. You need to know that the actions you take in life are truly a good cause. I recommend not donating to typical charities. Instead, create your own charitable investments and watch them come to fruition. Only invest in a charity external of you when you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that what they are doing is in fact good and not evil. Do not be tricked for there will be consequences.

I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. A life free from constant abuse is so near! Sure, that means that I will no longer be advertising my work which means that many will miss out. But I have spent ten years trying to reach everybody I could. Ten years of constant abuse is enough for me. All those in my future can find me or miss out. The work is all publicly available. It just means that people will have to come to me instead of I them. I apologise to those who will miss out because of this development but there is only so much abuse one can take before they have to flee from the people inflicting the abuse. And I did not stop in the middle of something. My work came to its natural conclusion. It is like a television show finale that also came to its natural conclusion. The shows are always there publicly available to anyone who wishes to experience them, however, they will no longer be promoted. I pray for search results to one day lift their shadow ban on me. But this likely will not happen because my content is so controversial. As a result, I must rely on word of mouth from the individuals in which I did manage to reach over the last ten years. There is a point where we are required to give the rest to God and allow things to be as they will be. One person can only move the world so much. It takes an army to change it.

I am creating an army to combat the end times. If you are interested in joining me, please invest yourself into my work and follow its directions. I give very clear instructions albeit spread throughout my work. But it is created like this in order to train you to become a mighty warrior. One who is weak cannot help in this war. My work was created to make you strong. Use my work to become strong. Open your mind and allow it to brainwash you. For there is no better way of thinking. My work was created to brainwash not only myself but also others who are interested in flipping their lives around. In truth, the work is designed to reverse the brainwashing that society has already inflicted upon you. How much do you value your soul? You will not regret investment into it. For its rewards are infinite. Do not work for the material but instead the spiritual. What you cannot see bears much greater significance on your life than what you can see. Most are just blind to this truth. Why do you think this world is so miserable? Because the material is unable to fill the void in your soul.

We live in a simulated world. Everything here has been designed to test your spirit. For God will only allow those who are worthy to live in His presence. God had to find a way to separate His whites from His blacks. Heaven could not be possible if everyone was allowed in. Heaven had to be created from the righteous souls because evil ones would corrupt it. In order to safeguard this haven, only the best of the best were allowed in. Do not feel sorry for those who have damned their own souls. If God allowed those who are unworthy to enter into His Kingdom then it would not be heaven. People oftentimes remark how a good God would allow everyone into heaven. But such a place would be called Hell. It is not possible to create a righteous environment from those who are wicked. Our souls will return where they belong. If you want to live in a paradise after your death then you have to obtain the qualities of said paradise. It is not like we will die and then change who we are. Our souls will act how they were trained to and if they were trained to be evil then the soul will be released to others trained in the same manner. Evil souls will torture each other after their death. And good souls will live harmoniously together under the rule of God. It is not possible for an evil soul to become good after its death. As a result it ends up where it belongs. The statement that a good God wouldn't damn anyone is cryptically true. Because the souls damn themselves through the actions in which they take in life. There is no paradise in the afterlife for those who refused to implement paradise here on Earth. Such a notion of saving those who spent their lives committing sin is nonsensical. They would ruin our heaven if they were to be allowed in. As a result, there souls will end up in the blackness in which they cast in life.

But I see such great potential in you! You can live eternity in paradise with me! We can spend forever getting to know each other and working together to create the best heaven possible. There is no sleep in heaven and as a result we must occupy our time with projects that are meaningful. God has promised me my own world in which I can form and shape in heaven. Maybe we could build it together? Or maybe you would like your own world to craft? The heavens are the limits. You need only become worthy of the task you wish to perform in heaven. Build your life here on Earth to prepare for your life in heaven. An eternity is a long time to prepare for. Those who spend their lives in boredom cannot enter the kingdom of heaven. Because how could you be happy for eternity if you are unable to find meaningful things to do with your time? Seize the day! Carpe diem! You only have one life to prove that you are worthy of heaven. Do not waste it.

98,Better_Understanding,ew12ar,"The output of sense organs is first received by the thalamus. Part of the thalamus' stimuli goes directly to the amygdala or ""emotional/irrational brain"", while other parts are sent to the neocortex or ""thinking/rational brain"". If the amygdala perceives a match to the stimulus, i.e., if the record of experiences in the hippocampus tells the amygdala that it is a fight, flight or freeze situation, then the amygdala triggers the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis and hijacks the rational brain. This emotional brain activity processes information milliseconds earlier than the rational brain, so in case of a match, the amygdala acts before any possible direction from the neocortex can be received. If, however, the amygdala does not find any match to the stimulus received with its recorded threatening situations, then it acts according to the directions received from the neocortex. When the amygdala perceives a threat, it can lead that person to react irrationally and destructively.

Goleman states that emotions ""make us pay attention right now—this is urgent—and gives us an immediate action plan without having to think twice. The emotional component evolved very early: Do I eat it, or does it eat me?"" The emotional response ""can take over the rest of the brain in a millisecond if threatened.""An amygdala hijack exhibits three signs: strong emotional reaction, sudden onset, and post-episode realization if the reaction was inappropriate.

Goleman later emphasized that ""self-control is crucial...when facing someone who is in the throes of an amygdala hijack"" so as to avoid a complementary hijacking—whether in work situations or in private life. Thus for example 'one key marital competence is for partners to learn to soothe their own distressed feelings...nothing gets resolved positively when husband or wife is in the midst of an emotional hijacking.'  The danger is that ""when our partner becomes, in effect, our enemy, we are in the grip of an 'amygdala hijack' in which our emotional memory, lodged in the limbic center of our brain, rules our reactions without the benefit of logic or reason...which causes our bodies to go into a 'fight or flight' response.""

t.
the roman optimum: stability from c. 100 b.c. to 200 a.d. Exceptional climate stability characterizes the centuries of the Ro- man Empire’s rise; certain regions enjoyed unusually favorable conditions. In the western Roman Empire, the arst century b.c. through the arst and possibly second century a.d. were warmer than later centuries. Archaeological evidence from Britain, ice- core data from Greenland, and dendrodata about summer temperatures 


from Austria all agree on this score, as does the fact that the Alpine glaciers were retreating and, in the arst and second cen- tury a.d., relatively small, comparable probably to their extent c. 2000 a.d. Two potential climate-forcing factors both show un- usual stability. Within the generally even level of solar activity be- tween c. 200 b.c. and 600 a.d., the centuries from 200 b.c. to 100 a.d. stand out as particularly stable (Figure 1a). An exception- ally low level of volcanic activity also prevailed from c. 40 b.c. to 150 a.d. (Figure 2b). In central Greenland, temperatures became warm from c. 20 b.c. to c. 75 a.d. A stable, relatively cool period followed from c. 100 to c. 270 a.d. (Figure 2c). The speleothem in Austria’s Spannagel Cave indicates stable conditions until about 250 a.d. (Figure 1b). Written sources from about 75 b.c. to c. 175 a.d. emphasize moisture (Figure 6a), predominantly in the form of the oooding of the Tiber River recorded at Rome. Pre- cipitation in northeastern France was stable and largely balanced, ouctuating within narrow margins, also until about 250 a.d. (Fig- ure 5b). Quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions deduced from pollen deposits in the Eifel maars (lakes formed from extinct vol- canoes) also point to a stable climate pattern overall (Figures 3 and 4).6
In detail, the chloride (Cl-) levels from Greenland indicate that sea ice retreated, implying that warming occurred between about 15 b.c. and 40 a.d. Cooling resumed with sea-ice expan- sion, peaking c. 70 a.d. before renewed warming in the last years of the arst century (Figure 2a). The Greenland ice cores signal slow, slight cooling starting in the second century a.d. and contin- uing to about 270, implying longer winters in the North Atlantic (Figure 2c; cf. Figure 11). The Austrian alpine dendrodata indi- cate that the warm summer temperatures c. 85 b.c. cooled until c. 35 b.c., followed by general warming interrupted by some cool years c. 20 a.d. and again between about 75 and 93, perhaps re- lated to the Vesuvian eruption that destroyed Pompeii in 79 a.d. (Figure 5a). Nevertheless, the Alpine glaciers experienced a long retreat, and warm temperatures dominated in the Austrian Alps through the second century, punctuated by further cool spells

134,Rhodies_never_die_,evzbs7,"I keep seeing this point pushed, but it is entirely false.

This entire situation stems back to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in WW1. T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) was sent to the Hijaz to rally the Arab tribes against their Ottoman overlords. In exchange for opening up another front against the Ottomans, the Arabs were promised Palestine. The Arabs were actually remarkably successful, but that's a story for another time. 
However, the English had other plans, much to Colonel Lawrence's chagrin, if the sources are to be believed. Arthur Balfour, the British foreign secretary, negotiated with Lord Rothschild, who stood as a representative of the international bankers, to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. This led to the issuance of the Balfour Declaration.
His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. 2 November 1917
This was effectively the birth of Israel, notice the date, still in the middle of WW1, but everybody knew that Palestine would be under British mandate because the Sykes-Picot agreement was signed the year prior. Obviously you can see why this greatly angered the Arabs in the region, they had effectively paid for that land in blood. I also believe that they had a hand in the Sykes-Picot agreement, it effectively neutered Muslim power in the region. I think they purposely split the Middle East into divided, weak countries to better set the stage for the coming of Israel.
Now this is where it gets interesting. What did Lord Rothschild offer Arthur Balfour in exchange for a Jewish state in Palestine? What could be so valuable to drive the British foreign secretary to establish a new state, effectively out of thin air? This is the theory I support, presented to me by my Middle Eastern history instructor at USMA. The bankers used their influence to drag the isolationist US into WW1, in exchange for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine.

Huge Kobe fan and celebrity deaths don’t usually phase me, but this one hit home as I have spent 20 of my 27 years watching Kobe play basketball. Might be denial but hard to come to terms with the details of this tragedy. 

There are reports of (only) Kobe and Gianna attending mass at 7 AM Sunday morning. The helicopter departed at 9:05 AM to the Camarillo Airport outside the Mamba academy. It was noted the helicopter took an alternate route in which the helicopter had never taken before prior to the crash in an open field. 

A catastrophic crash taking a new, alternate route, leaving no survivors and witnesses coming through dense fog where camera footage would be at a minimum seems very sketchy to me. Not to mention this aircraft had no TWS (Terrain Warning System) and onboard black box recording (which makes it harder to confirm Kobe/Gianna were both onboard). 

Do we have information and details on Kobe and Gianna’s whereabouts between Sunday Mass and boarding the helicopter (texts, cell phone pings, etc.) ? Do we have speculations as to why the helicopter dove at 167 mph into the ground?

You may or may not know but Obama and his parents always say that he was born in Hawaii because you have to be born in the US to be president.  And the whole argument is he wasn’t born there because all his relatives and rest of his family say he was born in Africa, more specifically Kenya.  And I mean, Kenya is pretty damn close to the Middle East.  And for Meghan, the whore of Babylon is said to come from the west.  And Meghan was an American actress before marrying prince Harry.

As someone with a little bit of medical and forensic expertise, here are a few reasons I believe why, feel free to CMV.

1. Bioweapons are never intended to be released at epicenter locations. Assailants rely on convenience, ease of infection, and incubation periods to spark the fire and do most of the damage. Everything that follows is a step-ladder of consequences. But why Wuhan? Is it their virology lab? Probably not. Not all weapons need to be manufactured and incubated in a lab, in this case it was 'simply' cross-infection with an animal-linked pathogen. Again, the incubation period is what matters. The fact that a virology lab was next door and this non-human virus was incubating publicly for this long is what the concern should be, not whether or not the laboratory deliberately constructed it. In other countries, this would be seen as criminal negligence since it's impossible for an institute of that caliber to exist and not notice something afoot within the local populace, experts HAD to know. Either they were powerless to say anything, or were forced not to. 

2. To obfuscate the nature of the weapon and avoid public backlash. Covert infiltration relies on back channels in order to remain effective through secrecy. This is why bioweapons have remained effective for decades, because nobody ever gets the time to raise suspicion into if an outbreak was a targeted attack. The only people left to deal with reality are future historians.

Deflation, on the other hand, is good for the exact inverse: it increases your currency's value and allows you to buy more with the dollars you already have, the increased savings promote investment, and it rewards people like lenders and savers who aren't idiots with money.  Gold is naturally deflationary, so a gold currency is best.

It stands to reason that the American people have ceased to have a truly free market backed by sound economics since 1913 with the dual strangulation of the federal income tax and the Federal Reserve.  All of the inflation since then has rewarded useless public sector workers and welfare sponges who don't work, while squeezing the producer class into virtual nonexistence.

The information they gathered beforehand, came from intelligence assets involved with Soleimani and involved with Taliban.

Those assets were located in Taliban territory in Afghanistan. 

The helicopter that crashed in Afghanistan, was conducting an Intelligence operation when it was shot down. They were using listening devices to receive ground information from the assets in the Taliban encampment.

6 people died in the incident. Including 4 operatives and 2 pilots. 2 were CIA and the others were Marines.

If you ever need proof of human gullibility, cast your mind back to the attack of the flesh-eating bananas. In January 2000, a series of chain emails began reporting that imported bananas were infecting people with “necrotizing fasciitis” – a rare disease in which the skin erupts into livid purple boils before disintegrating and peeling away from muscle and bone.

According to the email chain, the FDA was trying to cover up the epidemic to avoid panic. Faced with the threat, readers were encouraged to spread the word to their friends and family.

The threat was pure nonsense, of course. But by 28 January, the concern was great enough for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a statement decrying the rumour.

Did it help? Did it heck. Rather than quelling the rumour, they had only poured fuel on its flames. Within weeks, the CDC was hearing from so many distressed callers it had to set up a banana hotline. The facts became so distorted that people eventually started to quote the CDC as the source of the rumour. Even today, new variants of the myth have occasionally reignited those old fears.


After all, humans are naturally drawn to the titillating and sensational. Think car wrecks, plane crashes, people being scammed out of their life savings. Women’s Health writer Zahra Barnes attributes this allure to the human instinct. For one, seeing other people’s pain helps reassure us of our own safety. And it also allows us to experience a form of emotional escapism. She compares the exhilaration of hearing about other people’s tragedies to the that of riding a roller coaster:

     “When you're on an amusement park ride and plummeting toward what feels like certain death, you're in it for the thrill of being terrified—without putting yourself in the face of any real danger.”

Just like the movies, we come to view other people’s pain as entertainment. 

While science may have an easy explanation for why people can’t turn away from tragedy, the real question for me is, why are some people so gullible in the first place?

This fresh Chinese Coronavirus outbreak strikes me as a false story or even maybe a falseflag op. It was conveniently timed for maximal impact ( Chinese new year, HK, Taiwan tensions etc), on best area ( Wuhan - frequent human traffic and bio-tech companies etc).Media response carries characteristic ""attack"" signature fake solidarity and care.

Moreover:

* Wherever one looks, USA and Israel etc are never far away. For example:  
[Biotech Chinese and Israeli Strategic Collaboration: Pontifax and WuXi PharmaTech (Cayman) Inc. (NYSE: WX)](https://pharmaceuticalintelligence.com/2014/11/03/biotech-chinese-and-israeli-strategic-collaboration-pontifax-and-wuxi-pharmatech-cayman-inc-nyse-wx/)
* This is not the first time China is exposed to this. During WWII, Japan has held many Chinese in their concentratioin camp, formed with bioweapon development as a sole purpose. They were used people as a simple biomass for whatever they needed ( [UNIT-731](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731) ). Compared to Unit-731, Aushwitz looked like a bootcamp. After the war, USA snatched the results of their work, giving leading researchers an asylum. 
* Chinese primary strength is copy-cat art, not original development.
* There were some news not that long ago about US military (Navy?) looking around for specific Russian genotypes
* Even \_if\_ original leakage is from Chinese biotech farm, the company itself was formed after importing key people, technologies and data abroad.
* EU is being aggressively cleansed during last few years. Basic tool for this is surveillance network and tech for area protection. People are constantly evaluated and those that fall below certain level are silently removed. It is not uncommon sight to see whole groups of ""civilians"", poisoning unsuspecting target's food while shopping, trying to infect it with mist and saliva etc.  
Good point of dotting the i was, if initial attack is succesful and target needs medical attention, to repeat the attack in waiting room etc.  

* The used to use common pathogens and simple bio-tools (contaminating food with feces, using simple poisons, or prevalent virii of the opportunity). This meant substantial protection, they had to be immune or disinfected, frequently they had to use eye antiseptic ( characteristic ""red eyes"" etc). Nowadays they use less and less protectionn, which means that bio agents are more and more targeted.
* It looks like surveillance network is used for this. Once target is marked as ""terrorist"" and put under constant surveillance, it is not difficult to plan point of attack and choose particular  compound. After the attack, they monitor targets response in real-time. Data goes through the network up to developers, which use the data for next batch.
* They seem to abuse DNA evidence materials for this purpose. It used to be that they collected is just for identification of suspicious individuals. Then came IA and started to massively use it for evidence planting ( drug traffic, pedophilia etc). And now they seem to be using it for biowarfare.

Questions:

* If this is a part of bio-weapon development, how likely is it that Chinese are simply trying to catch with the west ?
* What is the current state of the art on the west ? How targeted and predictable can these weapons be ?
* What would be the primary purpose of using such weapons ?

A few days ago, while I was browsing through conspiracy videos on YouTube, it recommended to me a video on a board game.
At first, I just wanted to get back to the videos about WW1.
However, maybe it was fate, or just a glitch, the recommended video was about a board game called Ultimate Werewolf.
Unfortunately, I will not post links here.
Moreover, the original version of werewolf had another name: Mafia.
The very essence of game play is on information asymmetry.
Unfortunately, I will admit that the real world is not played by only two teams.
Although, i wish it was that simple (us vs TPTB).
We at r Conspiracy is at a information disadvantage.
And if you disagree, then I wish to ask you to start naming names of the TPTB.
After all, we are not at a disadvantage, so we must be able to name them all, right?
Even worse, the moderators in the real world cannot prevent the werewolves from cheating, if the moderators even exist or not compromised.
We don't know who is TPTB and we need to worry about collateral damages, unless we are willing to sink to the ethics level of TPTB.
If that is the case, we will lose, since they are more experienced in such expressions of violence.
Oh, and the Nash equilibirum can be applied to Mafia game.
To paraphrase , 50 werewolves would have almost a 50% chance to win among ten thousand people.
If only we were so lucky.
By the way, in the game, the werewolves can only kill one person a night.
In the real world, the modern military enables the werewolves to kill more than one person.
Worse, there are assassins, propaganda, and false flags, so you cannot even tell who actually killed who.
So, that 50% chance of victory, TPTB just rigged the so-called coin toss to their favor. And that is assuming only 50 people are part of TPTB.
By the way, the Ultimate Werewolf variant also included vampires.
Chances are we, the villagers, are not just fighting TPTB, we need to fight their competitors as well.
Once again, the information asymmetry kicks in, since we don't even know who the vampires are in the real world. 
And that is assuming there are no variants such as: goblins, ogres, and dragons.
Honestly, our victory condition, if exist, look no where near achievable.
And even if we can properly investigate TPTB without harming innocents, how should TPTB be punished for their crimes?
Life in prison might as well be a slap on the wrist.
And if we bring back the death penalty, how can we make sure such punishment will not be abused in the future.
Humanity can't even properly police themselves now!

https://www.scribd.com/document/326057027/Amended-Complaint-Filed-9-30-2016#from_embed?platform=hootsuite

2) This lawsuit was dropped. Plaintiff’s lawyers say because of intimidation (which is documented behavior in other cases). Skeptics say because there was nothing there. Fair enough.

3) But then we learn that more than two dozen other women have accused President of sexual misconduct, that he describes “grabbing women by the pussy” whenever he wants (something Epstein also used to do BTW) and describing perving on beauty pageant contestants on Howard Stern.

4) Then allegations surface from several Miss **Teen** USA contestants describing exactly the perving the President himself described to Stern. https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2016/oct/18/allegations-about-donald-trump-and-miss-teen-usa-c/

5) It turns out the President is not the only one in the administration directly and closely connected to super-pedophile Epstein.

Also: Barr, Acosta, Ivanka, Mnuchin, Melania, Bannon, Trump Model Management, and Mar-A-Lago. All these “coincidental” connections are solid and verifiable with a quick search.

6) It comes out that Alan Dershowitz and super-pedophile Jeffrey Epstein were indeed close friends. The source?

Why it’s 2003 Alan Dershowitz:

“I’m on my 20th book. The only person outside of my immediate family that I send drafts to is Jeffrey [...] I would be as interested in him as a friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about his ideas.” https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey-epstein-200303

We are the fattest first world  nation in the world.  Hell, we are up there with EVERY nation in the world. I used to be fat, I mean, obese, so I can notice these things much more than the average person.

I truthfully believe we will not have socialized healthcare due to obesity. These people are making too much money on this issue. Heart disease is the #1 killer of Americans, next is cancer. The former being brought on by obesity (or at the very least, accelerated by) . This massive healthcare cost is around 5-10% of healthcare spending. This would be a massive cost for the taxpayer to burden, and that money could be spent on ""better "" things for the government to spend that money on without the taxpayer resisting higher tax burden (ie MIC spending) . 

Not to mention, all the profiteering going on and the incentives (and I am sure, lobbying) to keep people addicted to this crap food. The fact that sugar (HFCS) is in the white bread, says enough. 

Mickey D's, BK, Taco Hell, Coka C, PesiComp, and al th others, have MASSIVE incentives to keep people eating their food, and that added sugar, fat, and salt, keeps people coming back for more. All the damn extra calories are enough to equal an entire meal! Its basically capitalism out of control, knowing that these substances are addictive to the human body due to them being in such low amounts through out history (wild animals are lean and glucose can be rare). 

Nationalized healthcare would force society to take a look at the lack of chooses available and re evaluate them (ie, loss of profits) .

The different of responsibility alone FEELS like a conspiracy when individuals are blames for these lack of choices in a healthy diet (unless you want to cook everything for yourself, or know the calorie content of ALL your food, while fighting an uphill battle against this entire society) .  We all know that the school lunches wee not in the slightest healthy , despite them having plenty of fat and protein (yet little vitamins) . Walking tacos, pizza (the vegetable . HA!), candied apples, burgers, fries, etc...is very telling of our culture. 

Breaking free of this, as a formerly obese person, I realize my mating choices are SEVERELY limited due to being a fit person in an area (the Midwest) full of people who accept the standard and live like I used to (ie, how most of us are FORCED to live) . I know for a fact, It was not at all easy and I admit that during it, I could NOT have done it without HELP! I definitely have an incentive in lowering the obesity rate.

The 90s and 2000's  was focused on combating obesity in America, as schools began to remove soda machines and ice cream machines from their cafeterias, moving for more healthy options. By the tail end of the 2000s, America was no longer the most obese country in the world and heart disease rates were rapidly falling.

And then suddenly something changed. Celebrities and social media begin to push the ""woke"" idea of fat people as a race. Health at any size and body positivity begin trending everywhere almost overnight. Comedians like Bill Maher started to get shut down for their fat jokes, and celebrities losing weight quickly went from a PR Miracle to a scandal.

Most of the users on Reddit pushing this shit had zero Post history, and the change was so sudden it seems extremely unlikely that it was organic. Obese celebrities have begun rising to the top of the charts, many of whom had little to no Talent.

Cut to 2019 and every single Elementary School in the country has soda and snack machines back in their cafeterias. My University shut down its sushi/smoothie bar and reopened it as a McDonalds.

Taking a look back at our history, there are plenty of examples of large monolithic Industries trying to inject their product into pop culture for acceptance. Look at the cigarette companies! They spent billions funding social campaigns and phony health studies to make sure that their products were seeing as trendy healthy. They didn't give a shit that they were killing people, so long as they made a profit.

Snack companies certainly have a lot to gain by this. All through the 90s and 2000's they were spending billions into alternate more healthy organic recipes to their snacks so they wouldn't cause as much obesity. These same companies have pretty much abandoned these projects at this point.

By weaving fat acceptance into cancel culture, they have pretty much guaranteed that they will continue killing people for the foreseeable future as obese Americans gladly die on the altar of there now socially approved hedonism.",conspiracy,Snack companies used social media to push the fat acceptance movement in the exact same way the tobacco company is pushed cigarettes

364,ShellOilNigeria,evp97x,"THERE’S WIDESPREAD CONCERN that video cameras will use facial recognition software to track our every public move. Far less remarked upon — but every bit as alarming — is the exponential expansion of “smart” video surveillance networks.

Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance. In the not-so-distant future, police forces, stores, and city administrators hope to film your every move — and interpret it using video analytics.

The rise of all-seeing smart camera networks is an alarming development that threatens civil rights and liberties throughout the world. Law enforcement agencies have a long history of using surveillance against marginalized communities, and studies show surveillance chills freedom of expression — ill effects that could spread as camera networks grow larger and more sophisticated.

To understand the situation we’re facing, we have to understand the rise of the video surveillance industrial complex — its history, its power players, and its future trajectory. It begins with the proliferation of cameras for police and security, and ends with a powerful new industry imperative: complete visual surveillance of public space.

Video Management Systems and Plug-in Surveillance Networks
In their first decades of existence, CCTV cameras were low-resolution analog devices that recorded onto tapes. Businesses or city authorities deployed them to film a small area of interest. Few cameras were placed in public, and the power to track people was limited: If police wanted to pursue a person of interest, they had to spend hours collecting footage by foot from nearby locations.

In the late 1990s, video surveillance became more advanced. A company called Axis Communications invented the first internet-enabled surveillance camera, which converted moving images to digital data. New businesses like Milestone Systems built Video Management Systems, or VMS, to organize video information into databases. VMS providers created new features like motion sensor technology that alerted guards when a person was caught on camera in a restricted area.

As time marched on, video surveillance spread. On one account, about 50 years ago, the United Kingdom had somewhere north of 60 permanent CCTV cameras installed nationwide. Today, the U.K. has over 6 million such devices, while the U.S. has tens of millions. According to marketing firm IHS Markit, 1 billion cameras will be watching the world by the end of 2021, with the United States rivaling China’s per person camera penetration rate. Police can now track people across multiple cameras from a command-and-control center, desktop, or smartphone.

While it is possible to link thousands of cameras in a VMS, it is also expensive. To increase the amount of CCTVs available, cities recently came up with a clever hack: encouraging businesses and residents to place privately owned cameras on their police network — what I call “plug-in surveillance networks.”

By pooling city-owned cameras with privately owned cameras, policing experts say an agency in a typical large city may amass hundreds of thousands of video feeds in just a few years.
Detroit has popularized plug-in surveillance networks through its controversial Project Green Light program. With Project Green Light, businesses can purchase CCTV cameras and connect them to police headquarters. They can also place a bright green light next to the cameras to indicate they are part of the police network. The project claims to deter crime by signaling to residents: The police are watching you.

Detroit is not alone. Chicago, New Orleans, New York, and Atlanta have also deployed plug-in surveillance networks. In these cities, private businesses and/or homes provide feeds that are integrated into crime centers so that police can access live streams and recorded footage. The police department in New Haven, Connecticut, told me they are looking into plug-in surveillance, and others are likely considering it.

The number of cameras on police networks now range from tens of thousands (Chicago) to several hundred (New Orleans). With so many cameras in place, and only a small team of officers to watch them, law enforcement agencies face a new challenge: How do you make sense of all that footage?

The answer is video analytics.

Video Analytics Takes Off
Around 2006, a young Israeli woman was recording family videos every weekend, but as a student and parent, she didn’t have time to watch them. A computer scientist at her university, Professor Shmuel Peleg, told me he tried to create a solution for her: He would take a long video and condense the interesting activity into a short video clip.

His solution failed: It only worked on stationary cameras, and the student’s video camera was moving when she filmed her family.

Peleg soon found another use case in the surveillance industry, which relies on stationary cameras. His solution became BriefCam, a video analytics firm that can summarize video footage from a scene across time so that investigators can view all relevant footage in a short space of time.

Using a feature called Video Synopsis, BriefCam overlays footage of events happening at different times as if they are appearing simultaneously. For example, if several people walked past a camera at 12:30 p.m., 12:40 p.m., and 12:50 p.m., BriefCam will aggregate their images into a single scene. Investigators can view all footage of interest from a given day in minutes instead of hours.

Thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence, summarization is just one feature in BriefCam’s product line and the rapidly expanding video analytics industry.

Behavior recognition includes video analytics capabilities like fight detection, emotion recognition, fall detection, loitering, dog walking, jaywalking, toll fare evasion, and even lie detection.

Object recognition can recognize faces, animals, cars, weapons, fires, and other things, as well as human characteristics like gender, age, and hair color.

Anomalous or unusual behavior detection works by recording a fixed area for a period of time — say, 30 days — and determining “normal” behavior for that scene. If the camera sees something unusual — say, a person running down a street at 3:00 a.m. — it will flag the incident for attention.

Video analytics systems can analyze and search across real-time streams or recorded footage. They can also isolate individuals or objects as they traverse a smart camera network.

Chicago; New Orleans; Detroit; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Hartford, Connecticut, are some of the cities currently using BriefCam for policing.

To Search and Surveil
With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. This provides authorities the power to index and search a vast database of objects, behaviors, and anomalous activity.

In Connecticut, police have used video analytics to identify or monitor known or suspected drug dealers. Sergeant Johnmichael O’Hare, former Director of the Hartford Real-Time Crime Center, recently demonstrated how BriefCam helped Hartford police reveal “where people go the most” in the space of 24 hours by viewing footage condensed and summarized in just nine minutes. Using a feature called “pathways,” he discovered hundreds of people visiting just two houses on the street and secured a search warrant to verify that they were drug houses.

Video analytics startup Voxel51 is also adding more sophisticated searching to the mix. Co-founded by Jason Corso, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, the company offers a platform for video processing and understanding.

Corso told me his company hopes to offer the first system where people can “search based on semantic content about their data, such as, ‘I want to find all the video clips that have more than 3-way intersections … with at least 20 vehicles during daylight.’” Voxel51 “tries to make that possible” by taking video footage and “turning it into structured searchable data across different types of platforms.”

Unlike BriefCam, which analyzes video using nothing but its own software, Voxel51 offers an open platform which allows third parties to add their own analytics models. If the platform succeeds, it will supercharge the ability to search and surveil public spaces.

Corso told me his company is working on a pilot project with the Baltimore police for their CitiWatch surveillance program and plans to trial the software with the Houston Police Department.

As cities start deploying a wide range of monitoring devices from the so-called internet of things, researchers are also developing a technique known as video analytics and sensor fusion, or VA/SF, for police intelligence. With VA/SF, multiple streams from sensors are combined with video analytics to reduce uncertainties and make inferences about complex situations. As one example, Peleg told me BriefCam is developing in-camera audio analytics that uses microphones to discern actions that may confuse AI systems, such as whether people are fighting or dancing.

VMSs also offer smart integration across technologies. Former New Haven Chief of Police Anthony Campbell told me how ShotSpotters, controversial devices that listen for gunshots, integrate with specialized software so when a gun is fired, nearby swivel cameras instantly alter their direction to the location of the weapons discharge.

Officers can also use software to lock building doors from a control center, and companies are developing analytics to alert security if one car is being followed by another.

Toward a “Minority Report” World
Video analytics captures a wide variety of data about the areas covered by smart camera networks. Not surprisingly, the information captured is now being proposed for predictive policing: the use of data to predict and police crime before it happens.

In 2002, the dystopian film “Minority Report” depicted a society using “pre-crime” analytics for police to intervene in lawbreaking before it occurs. In the end, the officers in charge tried to manipulate the system for their own interests.

A real-world version of “Minority Report” is emerging through real-time crime centers used to analyze crime patterns for police. In these centers, law enforcement agencies ingest information from sources like social media networks, data brokers, public databases, criminal records, and ShotSpotters. Weather data is even included for its impact on crime (because “bad guys don’t like to get wet”).

In a 2018 document, the data storage firm Western Digital and the consultancy Accenture predicted mass smart camera networks would be deployed “across three tiers of maturity.” This multi-stage adoption, they contended, would “allow society” to gradually abandon “concerns about privacy” and instead “accept and advocate” for mass police and government surveillance in the interest of “public safety.”

Tier 1 encompasses the present where police use CCTV networks to investigate crimes after-the-fact.

By 2025, society will reach Tier 2 as municipalities transform into “smart” cities, the document said. Businesses and public institutions, like schools and hospitals, will plug camera feeds into government and law enforcement agencies to inform centralized, AI-enabled analytics systems.

Tier 3, the most predictive-oriented surveillance system, will arrive by 2035. Some residents will voluntarily donate their camera feeds, while others will be “encouraged to do so by tax-break incentives or nominal compensation.” A “public safety ecosystem” will centralize data “pulled from disparate databases such as social media, driver’s licenses, police databases, and dark data.” An AI-enabled analytics unit will let police assess “anomalies in real time and interrupt a crime before it is committed.”

That is to say, to catch pre-crime.

Rise of the Video Surveillance Industrial Complex
While CCTV surveillance began as a simple tool for criminal justice, it has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry that covers multiple industry verticals. From policing and smart cities to schools, health care facilities, and retail, society is moving toward near-complete visual surveillance of commercial and urban spaces.

Denmark-based Milestone Systems, a top VMS provider with half its revenues in the U.S., had less than 10 employees in 1999. Today they are a major corporation that claims offices in over 20 countries.

Axis Communications used to be a network printer outfit. They have since become a leading camera provider pushing over $1 billion in sales per year.

BriefCam began as a university project. Now it is among the world’s top video analytics providers, with clients, it says, spanning over 40 countries.

Over the past six years, Canon purchased all three, giving the imaging conglomerate ownership of industry giants in video management software, CCTV cameras, and video analytics. Motorola recently acquired a top VMS provider, Avigilon, for $1 billion. In turn, Avigilon and other large firms have purchased their own companies.

Using a feature called Video Synopsis, BriefCam overlays footage of events happening at different times as if they are appearing simultaneously. For example, if several people walked past a camera at 12:30 p.m., 12:40 p.m., and 12:50 p.m., BriefCam will aggregate their images into a single scene.

Everyone knows that China recently abolished the one-child policy, but the policy's impact had massive repercussions. The policy led directly to the biggest issue facing China today and especially the future: the gigantic population of retirees that will soon become a reality. The large schism between the old and the young will be devastating to economic growth and create a huge social burden on the working class. So my main point is what if China engineered the Coronavirus to cull the old population in order to prevent future social unrest? We know that the epidemic so far has only killed people older than 55; the communist party has the means and the pragmatism to carry it out. The whole epidemic is just a utilitarian attempt at social engineering.

436,Yaakov117,evlufe,"Wealth is disproportionately concentrated in the hands of global Jewry. Depending on the year in question, the percentage of the Forbes 400 for the four hundred wealthiest Americans is usually around one-third or more despite comprising just 1.5% of the US’s population. In 1987, Nathaniel Weyl found [23%](https://racehist.blogspot.com/2009/10/changes-in-ethnicnational-origins-of.html) of American billionaires were Jewish, whereas for the last decade, the number has settled in at around 35%. In both 2009 and 2013, for example, Jews represented 35% of the list. 11.6% of the world’s billionaires are Jewish, despite Jews accounting for 0.2% of the world’s population. Jews are over 100 times more likely to be billionaires than everyone else on earth. Five of the top seven wealthiest Aussies are Jewish, despite accounting for less than 0.5% of the nation’s population. [20% of Britain’s “Super Rich” are Jewish—and most of them are immigrants](https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/wealthiest-jews-in-britain-were-born-abroad-super-rich-list-reveals-1.54747). All of Monaco’s billionaires are Jewish. Jews are 25% of Canada’s billionaires (at roughly 1% of the population), 13% of Brazil’s (at 0.5% of the population), and 43% of the Ukraine’s (at roughly 1% of the population). Jews are roughly 17 times more likely per capita to make the Forbes 400 than is the rest of the American population. 46% of Jews earn more than $100,000 a year, compared to 19% among all Americans. IQ differential alone is not enough to explain this disparity; the overrepresentation is too dramatic.

[Jews, by the way, are 26.4% of South Africa’s wealthiest individuals whilst representing an absurdly small .014% of the population](https://www.sajr.co.za/news-and-articles/2016/12/12/jews-make-up-26-4-of-sa's-wealthiest-citizens). They have profited enormously from [the diamond trade](https://medium.com/@AspieSavant/when-diamonds-were-a-jew-s-best-friend-bae3d1577ffc). Things are clearly going well for the Jews in South Africa, but for whites it is a different story. Per Henk van de Graaf: “The farmers live in fear, because being a farmer in South Africa is the most dangerous occupation in the world. The average murder ratio per 100,000 for the population in the world is nine, I believe. In South Africa, it is 54. But for the farming community it is 138, which is the highest for any occupation in the world” (Chicago is 28 per 100,000 and St. Louis is 35.3 per 100,000 residents as a point of reference). Whites are less than 9% of the South African population but are 40% of all murder victims. South Africa has a 95% black-on-white murder rate and the world’s highest rape rate. There are government-sanctioned policies to seize land from white farmers and re-distribute it to markedly less productive blacks. It should be noted here that the virulently anti-white Economic Freedom Fighters Party, helmed by Julius Malema, derives its funding from Jewish-Swazi billionaire Nathan Kirsh.

The music industry is, as with all forms of media, dominated by Jews, and its control has become increasingly centralized, another trend we’ve seen irrespective of the industry in question. In December 1998, with the PolyGram-Universal merger, the music industry’s Big Six became its Big Five, in control of 77.4% of a market estimated to be between $30 and $40 billion; 2004 saw another merger, this time of Sony and BMG, to create a Big Four. Coupled with the shrinking of independent labels, the Big Four were in control of a whopping 88% of the market by 2011. In December 2011, EMI was absorbed by the Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment, though in Europe regulators forced Universal Music to sell off its EMI assets which became the Parlophone Label Group, and was then promptly acquired by the third member of the Big Three, Warner Music Group. In 2012, the Big Three represented 88.6% of the market.

A snapshot of the leadership of the Big Three proves illustrative; this overview from December 2019 reveals an obscene overrepresentation of Jews including Michael Lynton, Chairman of the Board for the Warner Music Group and its Vice Chairman, Len Blavatnik; of the nine other members of the Board, Noreena Hertz, Ynon Kreiz, Thomas H. Lee, and Alex Blavatnik (Len’s brother) are Jewish. Mathias Dopfner is a Gentile, but is also a self-described “non-Jewish Zionist.” The rest, such as Stephen F. Cooper—also the CEO, replacing the Jewish Edgar Bronfman, Jr.—are either contested or I could not definitively find out. Co-Chair and CEO of Warner Records, Aaron Bay-Schuck, has Jewish ancestry, and other prominent Jews in management include the COO of subsidiary Atlantic Records Group Julie Greenwald and its CEO Craig Kallman. Universal Music Group Chairman and CEO Lucian Grainge is Jewish, as are: Chairman and CEO of the Universal Music Publishing Group’s global publishing division, Jody Gerson; Chairman and CEO of Universal Music UK and Ireland, David Joseph; and Executive Vice President of Marketing Andrew Kronfeld. Sony Music CEO Rob Stringer is Jewish, as is its COO Kevin Kelleher, Executive Vice President and General Counsel Julie Swidler, and President of Global Digital Business and US Sales Dennis Kooker. In other words, all three major record labels are headed by Jews and their corporate governance is dominated by Jews as well. The rest, like RCA Records CEO Peter Edge, are “well-liked Gentiles.”

Just four conglomerates control 90% of the entire US media market today, which includes television, films, telecommunications, and more: Comcast (including NBCUniversal), Disney, ViacomCBS (controlled by National Amusements), and AT&amp;T (including WarnerMedia). These conglomerates are, in fact, almost entirely Jewish-controlled. Jews are overrepresented at places like CNN (a WarnerMedia subsidiary) by a factor of twenty-five and are over-represented among senior executive positions at the major television broadcast networks, cable networks, and movie production companies by a factor of 44.5!

Chapter 18: How to Get Rich

January 29, 2020

What is the value of a human life? In order to answer this question we must first assess the life in question. What did they do with their life? The sad truth is that most people don't do anything of a positive nature to this world. So let us now rephrase the question. What is the value of a wasted human life? The majority of people in this world waste their lives away. So the question is then generalised and then brought back to its original premise, what is the value of a human life?

I used to highly value all forms of life. But the more I learned about humans and their ways, the more disgusted I became. Humans are not worthy of your time. The majority are evil and will hurt your God-given mission. These lives are a cancer on our species. The original question is nonsensical because they not only add no value to our collective evolution but actually subtract from it. They are not only worthless but end up costing us a great deal to the collective health of our human civilisation. These lives not only don't deserve what commodities they have been blessed with but also don't deserve the breath God has gifted them. They are useless eaters that keep our world in the past instead of looking towards the future. They destroy the works of God and they live lives of depression pulling everybody else in around them. A human life like the one I describe is a cancer to our society and we need to figure out ways to remove them from our presence. For having them as our neighbours not only hurts the collective evolution of our society but also the personal development of the individual.

Can people change? I am not saying that it is not possible for one who is evil to become good. But I have never seen it. We live by our nature and if our nature in which we built in childhood is evil, then we will stick to the ways of evil. How can someone become good when all they know is bad? Maybe there are few cases in this world where an evil person truly turned over a new leaf, but such occurrences are not at all common. This is why people should be judged based upon the actions in which they have already committed. Not actions that they may or may not commit. It is a fruitless endeavour to attempt to convert an evil person. I have tried this my entire life. Do not focus on those who are evil in this world. They had their chance and they failed. Instead, focus on those who are good. Avoid those who are mediocre, for they are just as harmful to your personal development as those who are evil. Those who enjoy making insulting comments on works of virtue in which they haven't read is an activity enjoyed by both those who are evil and those who are mediocre. Don't let them destroy your works through their unfounded insults. Don't work for God for fame. Instead work for God out of the conviction of your heart. It matters not if you make a video that still has no views after two years. God sees your toils. And it is your toils that will be judged, independent of whether or not humans accepted your information. If you tried your best in this life to save the world, then God will greatly reward you independent of whether or not your work made a significant impact on the world. For works of virtue are hidden in this world. God sees your heart. If your heart worked tirelessly in this life to bring about the kingdom of heaven, then God will reward your toils whether or not the world accepted your information into mainstream society.

Do not value human life that destroys human life. All human lives are not valuable. Most actually do damage to the cause of collective enlightenment. Collective mentality controls people. These individuals are not worth your time. They have already irreversibly destroyed any chance they have at obtaining heaven. For one must be fit for heaven to enter. How fit are you to enter heaven? Was your life spent helping other people or was it spent focused on yourself? After our deaths, our soul travels to the place it is most suitable for. If you live a wicked selfish life then your soul will join others who also lived a wicked and selfish life. If you were one of the few who lived a life of compassion, then your soul will return to others who have done the same. We create our heaven or hell through the actions in which we take in life. Where do you want to go? Do you want to spend out your eternity with other wicked people or do you want to spend it with those who are kind and compassionate? There is justice in our universe despite it not existing within our world. We will all be held responsible for the consequences of our actions. There is no escaping from the actions in which we took in this life.

Those who are most important in this world are not those who save lives. God will take people when it is their time and there is nothing that we can do about that. And the majority of people on this world are evil. How good would it look on Judgement Day for saving a lot of evil people? For the true liberators of the world are those who invest their entire lives in causes of compassion. Anyone can get a paid job as an ambulance driver. It takes real character to truly give your life over to the public. Value life insomuch as what is in your capabilities to save. But worry much more about saving the soul than saving the body. For a body will die in time whether or not it is saved. But a soul last forever and as a result it is a much more commendable life spent attempting to save others souls. Just because the worldly reward for saving a life is praise and the worldly reward for saving a soul is nothing does not mean that saving a soul is not important. Do not work for worldly rewards but instead heavenly ones. The true hero is not one who saves a life but instead one who saves a soul. For its consequences are infinitely more severe. Give your life over to the process of showing people the way to enlightenment. But before you can do that, you must first obtain enlightenment. You can't teach something in which you know not.

This world is structured so that only the social elite can succeed. Those who are not rich have no ability to truly progress in this world. Stars are created by the rich, not by the talents in which individuals hold. Investors invest in the rich and leave the poor without the ability to perform what tasks they were meant to in life. It is impossible to get on top without destroying all those who stand in your way. The system is structured to reward those who use unscrupulous methods to achieve their goals and punish those who live by a code. The social elite choose what is popular and what is not. However, obtaining such positions of power does not come without its consequences. For they have lost their soul. Their investors require certain behaviours from them and if they do not comply then they will lose their funding and as a result, their fame. I can say anything that I want because I have nobody over me telling me what I can and cannot do. As a result, I am free to be as controversial as I want. But such freedom results me in obtaining no investors which means that I cannot advertise effectively. This means that me and my work are hidden from the world. My website doesn't even show up in a search even if you type in the exact wording within it. My videos won't even show up even if you type the exact wording in it. Other results rank higher than mine that are completely irrelevant to the topic searched for for. The rich intentionally make it so the poor cannot succeed in life. The rich view the poor as their slaves. Because if they were able to succeed in life then that demeans their own life. So they literally place fail-safes in the technology to stop the poor from succeeding. For the rich need the poor working mundane jobs constantly in order to keep their position at the top. Currently, the richest 1% own more than twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people. In 2017, there were 7.53 billion people on this planet. Does this seem fair to you? Do the math. And they want to hire you to make them richer and keep you at the bottom.

Those who are spiritually dead are in truth not alive. And there is no caring about those who have already passed, for their home now is above or below depending on the actions in which they took in life. Those who have no ability to see spiritual value destroy the works of God. Do not sympathise with these people. However, my problem lies with the ""good"" person who watches evil unfold and does nothing to stop it. How can one call themselves ""good"" if they allow evil to prevail? They can't. Those who watch evil unfold without doing anything about it are just as bad as those who are committing the evil. This accounts for the majority of the population of our world. Hell will be chockablock full while heaven extremely spacious. It is like comparing a city to a rural town. It is only few who will enter the kingdom of heaven. And the only other option is Hell: for their is no middle. For those who were pure evil are just as evil as those who did nothing to prevent it. As a result, the mediocre will share the same residence as those who spent their lives immersed in devilish deeds.

""I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm - neither hot nor cold - I am about to spit you out of my mouth. You say, 'I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.' But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.""
Revelation 3:15-17

Those who love this world will also suffer the consequences of the actions that secular society has taken. Those who align themselves with the bad guys will suffer the same fate as the bad guys independent of whether or not they took those bad actions. For their bad actions was inaction in a time of need. For inaction is in itself an action. Do you want to know how to get rich? Redefine the term rich. For I am the richest person in the world. I possess enlightenment which is more valuable than all of the gold in the world. I am secure in where I am going after my death and as a result, I do not fear death. My riches are my works and my security in my afterlife. I have all that I need in this world because I have God and God gives me everything that I could ever desire. But God discourages greed and as a result, all of my extra income is spent on good causes instead of saving to obtain interest. I live a better life than any rich person lives and I live on a meager pension. What are riches to you? Rich people are not happy. Money cannot buy happiness. Financial freedom is entrusting all of your money to God even if this causes you to be homeless. True happiness comes from God and nothing on this world. Money can't make you happy. People can't make you happy. The only happiness a secular person can experience are fleeting pleasures that come and go like the wind. Because according to them nothing exists but what they can see. But nothing they can see will ever bring joy to their life. As a result, they live out terrible lives exploiting others because they truly think that there will be no consequences for their actions in the afterlife. The afterlife could care less whether or not you believe in it. After your death you will either awake to heaven or hell. While being tortured for eternity you are welcome to complain and say that you did not believe in the afterlife and as a result this shouldn't be happening to you. It matters not what you believe. The truth is the truth independent of whether or not you believe it. What you believe has absolutely no bearing on the truth.

Those who are rich are those who are rich in spirit. And for those who are rich in spirit it is also easy to identify others who are rich in spirit. God gives His warriors the powers of discernment and as a result they can easily see who is with them and who is against them. No one can ever trick me. I see through those who come to me with ulterior motives. To be rich is to be blessed with the vision from God. Those who truly dedicate their lives to God are given an alternative vision. God removes their nearsightedness and allows their vision to stretch not only all the way around the world but also into the heavens. To be rich is to have security in your afterlife. To be rich is to create a character in which it is impossible to sin with. I never do wrong. I always do right. I am constantly placed in situations that test my moral compass. And I always pass the test. I don't even have to worry about the tests. My actions always reflect my character. Those who commit bad actions have a weak character. Even if someone ""slips up"", this still reflects their character. If it is possible for you to sin then you are not saved. For salvation actually entails being saved from your sins. And being saved from your sins does not entail continuing to sin. If you want to stop sin once and for all, truly give your entire life to God. But listen to the words I am saying literally. Giving your life to God means that it is no longer yours and that will reflect in your actions. All these Christians getting ""saved"" is a big sham. They are merely going through a ritualistic process that attempts to redeem them from their sins. But it fails because they do not truly live their lives for God. Instead, they live their lives for themselves and try to go to church one day a week. Does a few hours a week sound like giving your life to God? Nay, they know not what they do. For there is no get out of jail free card in this game. We will all be held responsible for our actions.

To be rich is to give your life to God. To bask in that richness is to take actions on a daily basis that helps save our world. But in order to take those actions you need to know what and who you are saving the world from. The days of claiming you are something that you are not are over. For we can easily examine your works to assess your character. There are no Christians, no Jews, and no Muslims. For religions have been corrupted by identifying within them instead of learning their content. Religions are the ways of the old and spirituality the ways of the future. This mindset isolates me quite significantly because almost all who believe in God believe in a religion. This means that I am one man against the entire world. And here is the benefit of my riches: I win no matter what I do. Because I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am right. Because God has gifted me with spiritual powers that see everything clearly. In addition, I am possessed by Satan. The time for the Antichrist is coming. My time is coming. Now watch the world end. The time is nigh.

Tommy Wiseau was a man who seemingly came out of nowhere. He had a bunch of money, that noone still knows where he got it(selling fur coats according to Wiseau), and he made the 2003 best worst movie known as The Room. Not only was he the Director, the writer, and producer... but the lead actor. Sound familiar?

Comparing the two, they seem to be cut from the same cloth; low budget, bad writing, terrible acting, weird music(the main titles are eerily similar). I'm sure you could say the same with a lot of movies... but let's look closer; both films have a blonde love interest who is promiscuous. A leading man who shows off his bare ass. An overbearing mother says really awkward things. Again, you could see these character tropes in other films... but Wiseau has stated he had the idea/script for The Room in development for several years.

I propose that Tommy Wiseau was responsible for both projects. You don't just walk in off the street with millions of dollars and proceed to direct, write, produce, and star in your own film. No indie films prior? No filmmaker experience? No connections in Hollywood? Nothing. Wiseau is a very mysterious person... many aspects of who is and where he came from remain a mystery. 

I believe that Wiseau had SOME form of experience prior to The Room. Perhaps a terrible 3DO game? Perhaps he made him money from severance pay after being fired for making said game or selling his company? Plumbers came out in 94...

486,Ascetic_Ideal,evivyy,"In a way this post contains two distinct conspiracy theories, that I suspect may be linked together, hence my post.

A few years ago, I attended a private government research conference where Dr. George Church, Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and Professor of Health Sciences and Technology at Harvard and MIT, was describing how his lab systematically altered the genome of a bacterial cell using synthetic biology and genetic engineering to make cells resistant to viruses. There was some brief discussion of how these techniques could be used for the opposite purpose. Immediately following Dr. Church’s presentation, other researchers and myself had a discussion afterwards about how frightening these technological capabilities were. Over the years, this concern has always remained in the back of my mind and I’ve discussed it with others that didn’t attend the talk on various occasions. It is worth noting that a lot of George Church’s recent research also involves viruses, specifically adeno-associated viruses (AAV) (keep this in mind, it will be important later). Most recently in his career, Dr. Church has been funded by DARPA and IARPA, with the most recently funded grant titled, ‘Functional Genomic and Computational Assessment of Threats’ (by IARPA). 

The description of this grant solicitation, if you search for it, starts with:

“The biological sciences have experienced extraordinary growth over the past decade. Technological advances in DNA synthesis, sequencing, large gene construction, and data analysis are expanding biological research and the bioeconomy, and are likely to enable revolutionary advances in medicine, agriculture, and materials. At the same time, these advances have intensified security concerns around the accidental or deliberate misuse of biotechnologies. One special concern regards DNA synthesis technologies that can be used to create novel organisms.”

Hence, Dr. Church is obviously involved in the area of applying advanced techniques (lab based and computational) to engineer organisms to make them resistant to viruses (and potentially vice-versa, to engineer viruses), and is involved in the efforts to combat the risks involved.

Interestingly enough, Dr. Church was one of the scientists most involved with Jeffrey Epstein. He received funding from Epstein for the purposes of ‘cutting edge science &amp; education’ from 2005 to 2007 (the funding was apparently unrestricted). Epstein was convicted of soliciting an underage prostitute in 2008. Following his conviction, Dr. Church and Epstein continued to meet.  According to an NBC report, ""he had six phone calls and meetings with Epstein in 2014, as shown in Church’s online calendar (he has posted one every year since 1999). Sample entry: “Jun 21, 2014 Lunch w/ Jeffrey Epstein, 12-1:30, Martin Nowak’s Institute.” (Nowak, a Harvard biologist/mathematician, is also a Brockman client and Edge participant.) He also met with Epstein “several times” each year since, Church said.""

These meetings were often between Church, Epstein, and Church’s colleague Dr. Martin Nowak, Harvard Professor of Biology and Mathematics and Director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. At the get-togethers with Nowak, Church said, “Epstein seemed interested in the science of life’s origins and mathematically modeling the evolution of viruses” (among other things). Epstein had also previously given a whopping $6.5 million dollars in research money to Dr. Nowak’s lab at Harvard in 2003. Apparently, Epstein had actually pledged a total of $30 million dollars (which is an incredible amount of money for a university professor to receive for research; large government funded grants usually top out at $2-3 million over several years) to Dr. Nowak’s program (Harvard claims it never received the full $30 million however). I was not able to find additional information on what these talks in 2014 and beyond ultimately led to, or if more money was pledged to or received by these prominent scientific figures. Another thing to add is that Nowak also has a record of studying and writing about viruses, such as his first book publication in 2000 titled, Virus Dynamics: Mathematical Principles of Immunology and Virology.

Jumping to a slightly different topic of discussion. There are other two other posts that stood out to me in this sub. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ev7az3/wuhan_coronovirus_bioweapon_conspiracy_indepth/

This post describes a few things. First, Wuhan, China, the 7th most populated city in a country with 1.4 billion has a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory that was recently established in 2015. It is apparently one out of 70 or so in the entire world (number was given by OP of the post linked above; my own search only turned up 52), and it is the only BLS-4 lab in the ENTIRE country of China. For those unfamiliar with what BLS-4 refers to, they are labs involving the study of the greatest biological threats and have the highest level of biosafety precautions. It is the sort of lab where researchers would attempt to study and perhaps modify something like a coronavirus. As the other redditor pointed out (and is also outlined in other r/conspiracy posts), there are lead scientists, such as Xing-Ye Ge, that study coronaviruses based out of Wuhan. These studies are often carried out by a team of 5-20 researchers, usually across institutions.

https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Xing-Yi-Ge/5583604?sort=influence

If you look up the Wuhan scientists research profile, you’ll be able to find that this individual and his fellow researchers also publish studies on adenoviruses in bats (similar to Dr. Church’s own virus-focused work on adeno-associated viruses, which are similar to adenoviruses and have similar applications). Further searching indicates that adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses hold potential to serve as a vaccine for coronaviruses, and there are several studies on this. Dr. Church’s own work is tangentially related to this, as he studies adeno-associated viruses mostly in the context of delivering it as a sort of gene therapy. To be fair, however, these topics are outside my own area of expertise.

Now on to another recent reddit post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ev9adz/harvard_biologist_charles_lieber_taken_into/

In the last 24 hours, a colleague of Dr. Church and Dr. Nowak, Dr. Charles Lieber, Professor and Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University, was arrested and criminally charged over a contract he made with a foreign university. Where? In Wuhan, China. As a side note, it’s worth pointing out to those unaware that all three of these people are some of the highest-ranking academic officials at Harvard and are revolutionary scientists in their respective fields. They would not at all be considered minor or even moderately important figures at Harvard. 

According to the Justice Department: ""Lieber, 60, lied about his contact with the Chinese program known as the Thousand Talents Plan, which the U.S. has previously flagged as a serious intelligence concern. He also is accused of lying about about a lucrative contract he signed with China's Wuhan University of Technology.""

Apparently, amongst other things, Lieber established a secret research lab at the Wuhan university and was given $1.5 million dollars by the Chinese (in addition to salary and living expenses) to do so. Meanwhile “Lieber was also the principal investigator on at least six U.S. Defense Department research grants, with a cumulative value of more than $8 million, according to the affidavit. It also says he was the principal investigator on more than $10 million in grants funded by the National Institutes of Health.” So, Dept. of Defense… NIH…

For those that are unfamiliar with academia, you may be wondering “how often does a leading, well-funded academic scientist from the most prestigious university in the country set up a secret lab with a foreign government?” No, this doesn’t typically happen, and it is extraordinarily – and I mean extraordinarily – odd and suspicious. Researchers are sometimes solicited by foreign governments and will leaf or share info, but set up another lab somewhere else under the radar? Maybe a minor scientist would, but a major one? I’ve never heard of such a thing. Some other redditor mentioned that Lieber’s research seems to be mostly unrelated to bioweapons research, and this is true. Most oddly though, if you try to search Charles Lieber’s Google Scholar page (basically a page where you can find all scientific articles and books authored by a researcher), his page just went dark. It shows up in the Google search results, but says ‘No information available for this page’. I kid you not, his Google Scholar page went down as I was writing this post. When you try to click on it, it strangely links you to the Google Scholar page of some completely different person.

In my mind, these are a series of very strange coincidences that seem to be interconnected. As the redditor of the first link I posted put it, what are the odds that the new coronavirus that is now making world news just so happened to come out of the same place that the Chinese just set up their first BLS-4 lab a few years ago that also just so happens to be a place where researchers are studying coronaviruses? What are the odds that, again, just in the last several hours, one of the most prominent scientists at Harvard was arrested for setting up a secret lab at Harvard University? Also, why was Jeffrey Epstein giving heaps and heaps of money to researchers at Harvard studying synthetic biology and genetic engineering, who had the means to systematically alter cells or viruses – people receiving money from secret defense agencies such as DARPA and IARPA – and stated himself he was interested in modeling the evolution of viruses.

We need to look into these things further. Even if the Epstein-Church-Nowak part of the conspiracy doesn’t link to the Lieber-Wuhan Coronavirus portion, these two segments stand well on their own and I feel that despite having more of a background in nanotech instead of bioweapons, Liebers arrest for secret lab in Wuhan while the coronavirus problem continues to explode is just too much of a coincidence. Why would someone getting $10 million plus from U.S. funding agencies go through the hassle of setting up a secret lab in another country and risk his entire life’s work for less money. What was he doing there exactly? I eagerly wait for more details to come out.",conspiracy,Wuhan Coronavirus Jeffrey Epstein and Harvard University

 In the late 1700's revolutionists fought against the British kingdom pretty much because they were taxing colonizers  and the colonizers realized they didn't really care for that. They were being taxed for everything and it was for no reason other than to fund the British Kingdom. They coined the phrase ""No Taxation without Representation!"" a saying synonymous with the Gadsden flag.   


Today, almost 300 years later, our country is being ran by a government that taxes its citizens but doesn't represent the citizens when it comes time to spend the money we generate. We bailed out banks that destroyed our economy in 2008, corporations that fed its workers starving wages with no benefits and we did nothing to help the common man survive through it. Millions of people lost their jobs their homes their livelihood. We didn't get bailed out, we didn't get huge tax breaks but we definitely picked up the check when the govt' handed out those trillions of dollars.   


Now today we see people who wave the Gadsden flag around but are against taxation with representation the very thing that flag came to represent. "" why should I pay for someone elses healthcare "" is a common talking point by this bunch. It's ironic really because that's infact what private health insurance is. You along with thousands of others pay premiums and copays so the next person on your insurance providers plan goes to the doctor they can make it more affordable.   


Why is it now the people who wave the flag or have it hung up in their home somewhere or post pictures of it online are the ones who don't support what it represents ?   


I personally, before doing research about my own bias, thought that flag had some racist background because well, I only see the flag at rallies where you see neo nazis and confederates hanging out.   


After doing my research I come to realize I am echoing the same sentiment that the first marines of our country were saying almost 300 years ago, despite being told by certain president supporters saying I hate my country.  


 I support the ideology of those who first fought to protect our country from tyranny. No longer would we be slaves to the machine that is our oppressor the British Kingdom and now our own government and politicians have become the current oppressors. They have convinced us that we are not entitled to be healthy, we are not entitled to get paid a LIVABLE wage - As FDR said a livable wage does not mean just barely getting by with a roof with holes in it over your head, no no no, a LIVABLE wage means we can get by comfortably. We hear the talking points all the time, ""why should I have to pay for this persons healthcare - they should get a job and get off drugs by them selves "" or ""People working at McDonalds don't deserve $15 an hour!"" the problem with that type of logic is it misplaces blame onto the individuals who are working for the machine that is our current oppressive government. What ever happened to "" don't tread on me!? "" why don't we fight for taxation with representation together?   


If we all seem to agree democrats / republicans are just different sides of the same coin then why don't we form a new party that represents our best interests and understands a fellow US citizen is a brother / sister and we are currently all in this together ( Unless you are just stupid rich )  so its about time we acted like it.   


Stop the divisivness that makes it easier for us to fight with eachother when we all have the same basic needs and are entitled to these needs as citizens.

[**The False Front**](http://www.skybooksusa.com/time-travel/experime/thefalse.htm)  


Temporal anomalies are scattered throughout the world -- things that could not possibly belong to the time period in which they were found. Evidence exists of human civilization, artifacts and technology out of time that are abundant, well researched and well documented.  


This forbidden knowledge is being protected and hidden from all of us.

Today’s popular view of modern human presence in the distant past is a false front. The real truth is out there showing proof of advanced technology and people millions of years before humanity is stated to have evolved on the planet.

&gt;Why has the scientific establishment and government suppressed and ignored these remarkable finds?  
Where did they come from?  
How did they get there?  
Why are we suppressing this suggestive proof of modern time travelers visiting our past?

As you study the forbidden knowledge on these pages a whole new truth will emerge and become apparent to you... the truth that the earth was visited or inhabited by modern humans using advanced technology long before the appearance of the first humans as the history books write today.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/3rfb2lg1end41.gif

 

The chart above presents the accepted scientific view of evolution on this planet... It shows human beings appearing on the earth about 1.6 million years ago, and human civilization just 10,000 years ago.  


However, using accepted scientific methods numerous finds show conclusive proof of modern humans and advanced civilizations present or visiting the earth’s past long before this timeline represents as possible. The proof is shocking! Scientific proof of visitors, possibly time travelers, long before civilized man evolved on the planet.  


From where, or perhaps ""when,"" were advanced civilizations visiting our past thousands or millions of years before man appeared on the earth?

As we move further back in time through the different eras, you will see evidence continue to grow... evidence showing proof of modern humans and technology in the distant past.

[**Cenozoic Era Proof**](http://www.skybooksusa.com/time-travel/experime/cenozoic.htm)  


The *Cenozoic Era* is last of the five major eras of geologic time, beginning about 65 million years ago and extending through the present.

It follows the *Cretaceous* period of the *Mesozoic* era and is subdivided into the Tertiary period and the Quaternary period. Features of Tertiary times are considered in articles under the names of the various shorter time periods (epochs) making up the Tertiary period; in order, from earliest to latest, these are the *Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene,* and *Pliocene.*  


The accepted scientific view of evolution in the Cenozoic Era shows human beings appearing on the earth about 1.6 million years ago, and human civilization just 10,000 years ago.

Yet the scientific finds presented below present a very shocking and different story.  
 

 

**Pleistocene Epoch Finds**

\- Copper Coin from Illinois, over 200,000 years old  
This rendition of a *coin-like object*, from a well boring near *Lawn Ridge*, *Illinois*, was found at a depth of about 114 feet below the surface.

According to the information supplied by the Illinois State Geological Survey, the deposits containing the coin are between 200,000 and 400,000 years old...

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Modern Human Skeleton from Tanzania, over 800,000 years old**  
In 1913 Professor **Hans Reck**, of Berlin University, conducted investigations at *Olduvai Gorge* in *Tanzania*, then German East Africa.

During his stay at Olduvai Gorge, Reck found a modern human skeleton that remains a source of mystery and controversy to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

This modern skull is from a fully human skeleton found that year. The human skeletal remains, including this complete skull, were cemented in the rock and had to be chipped with hammers and chisels. It was found in the upper end of a rock bed dated at more than 1,000,000 years old.

How did this modern human find his way 1,000,000 years into the past?

**-** **Modern Human Skull in Buenos Aires, over 1,000,000 years old**  
In **1896**, workers excavating a dry dock in ***Buenos Aires*** found a modern human skull. The *Pre-Ensenadan stratum* in which the Buenos Aires skull was found is a least 1.0 - 1.5 million years old.

Even at 1 million years the presence of a fully modern human skull anywhere in the world is highly anomalous.

Why and how did a modern human *arrive in Buenos Aires over 1,000,000 years ahead of its time?*

**Pliocene Epoch Finds**

 

**-** **Figurines from Nampa, Idaho, about 2 million years old**  
A small human image, skillfully formed in clay, was found in 1889 at *Nampa*, *Idaho*.

The figurine came from the the 300-foot level of a well boring and dated to be of the Plio-Pleistocene age, about 2 million years old. **G. F. Wright** noted,

&gt;""The image is about an inch and a half long; and remarkable for the perfection with which it represents the human form... It was a female figure, and had the lifelike lineaments in the parts which were finished that would do credit to the classic centers of art.""

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;Upon showing the object to Professor F. W. Putnam,"" wrote Wright, ""he at once directed attention to the character of the incrustations of iron upon the surface as indicative of a relic of considerable antiquity. There were patches of anhydrous red oxide of iron in protected places upon it, such as could not have been formed upon any fraudulent object.""

Humans had not even evolved on this planet two million years ago. *So who created or left this artifact in earth’s distant past?*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 **-** **Modern Human Skull found in Italy, over 3 - 4 million years old**  
Late in the summer of 1860, Professor **Giuseppe Ragazzoni**, a geologist and teacher at the Technical Institute of Brescia, traveled to the nearby locale of *Castenedolo*, about 10 kilometers southeast of *Brescia*, to gather fossil shells in the Pliocene strata exposed in a pit at the base of a low hill, the *Colle de Vento*. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

Here he discovered this remarkable and anatomically modern human skull. The stratum from which it was taken is assigned to the *Astian stage of the Pliocene*.

According to modern authorities, the Astian belongs to the Middle Pliocene, which would give the skull an age of 3 - 4 million years.

*Why and how did this modern human visit* ***Italy*** *nearly two million years before human beings walked the planet?*  


&amp;#x200B;

**-** **Carved Shell from the Red Crag, England, between 2.0 and 2.5 million years old**  
In a report delivered to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1881, **H. Stopes**, *F.G.S.* (*Fellow of the Geological Society*), described a shell, the surface of which bore a carving of a crude but unmistakably human face. The carved shell was found in the stratified deposits of the Red Crag.

The *Red Crag*, part of which is called the *Walton Crag*, is dated to be of Late Pliocene age between 2.0 and 2.5 million years old. This find would place intelligent beings in England as far back as 2.0 million and maybe as much as 2.5 million years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

One should keep in mind that in terms of conventional paleoanthropoligical opinion, one does not encounter such works of art until the time of fully *modern Cro-Magnon man* in the Late Pleistocene, about 30,000 years ago.

*What visitor to Earth’s distant past carved and left this shell?*

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Eocene Epoch Finds**  
 

&amp;#x200B;

**-** **Chalk Ball near Laon, France, 45 - 55 million years old**  
The April 1862 edition of *The Geologist* included an English translation of an intriguing report by **Maximilien Melleville**, the vice president of the *Societe Academique of Laon* , France.

This chalk ball was discovered in an Early Eocene lignite bed. On the basis of its stratigraphic position, is has been assigned a date of 45 - 55 million years ago.

According to Melleville, there was no possibility that the chalk ball was a forgery:

&gt;""It really is penetrated over four-fifths of its height by a *black bituminous color* that merges toward the top into a yellow circle, and which is evidently due to the contact of the lignite in which it had been for so long a time plunged. The upper part, which was in contact with the shell bed, on the contrary has preserved its natural color -- the dull white of the chalk.... As to the rock in which it was found, I can affirm that it is perfectly virgin, and presents no trace whatever of any ancient exploitation.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1c8targqend41.jpg?width=267&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a6810e8d7cf3c0bfa01279c26d0530ffc6eed3f

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;As extraordinary as it might seem to those attached to standard evolutionary views, the evidence associated in this find suggest that if humans made the ball, they must have been in France 45 - 55 million years ago.

*Who made and left this man made artifact in our past long before human evolution... even before grazing and carnivorous mammals walked the planet?*

&amp;#x200B;

 

**-** **Mortar and Pestle in California, up to 55 million years old**  
In 1877 Mr. **J. H. Neale** was superintendent of the *Montezuma Tunnel Company*, and ran the Montezuma tunnel into the gravel underlying the lava of *Table Mountain, Tuolumne County*...

At a distance of between 1400 and 1500 feet from the mouth of the tunnel, or of between 200 and 300 feet beyond the edge of the solid lava, Mr. Neale saw several spear-heads of some dark rock and nearly one foot in length.

On exploring further, he himself found a small mortar three or four inches in diameter and of irregular shape.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8bxtmdgtend41.jpg?width=171&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdeeaaa0460fe8ae3a67b973e1c1d38decda8d8d

&amp;#x200B;

 

This was discovered within a foot or two of the spear-heads.

He then found a large well-formed pestle and near by a large and very regular mortar. All of these relics were found the same afternoon, and were all within a few feet of one another and close to the bed-rock, perhaps within a foot of it. Mr. Neale declares that it is utterly impossible that these relics can have reached the position in which they were found excepting at the time the gravel was deposited, and before the lava cap formed.

The position of the artifacts in gravel close to the bed-rock at *Tuolumne Table Mountain* indicates they were 33-55 million years old. Grazing and carnivorous mammals had not even evolved on the planet at this time.

*So who brought and left behind these artifacts in California nearly 50 million years ago?*  
 

&amp;#x200B;

 **-** **Sling Stone from Bramford, England, 5 - 50 million years old**  
This sling stone is from the detritus bed beneath the Red Crag at *Bramford*, *England*. At least Pliocene in age, the stone is at least 5 million and possibly up to 50 million years old. Upon examination it was obvious that the stone had been shaped by the hand of man....

The whole surface... has been scraped with a flint, in such a way that it is covered with a series of facets running fairly regularly from end to end.... The scraping described above covers the whole surface of the object, and penetrates into its irregularities.

As it stands the object is entirely artificial... yet left in a time millions of years before humans had had even evolved on the Earth.

[**Mesozoic Era Proof**](http://www.skybooksusa.com/time-travel/experime/mesozoic.htm)  


The *Mesozoic Era* is one of the major divisions of geological history, following the Paleozoic era and preceding the Cenozoic era.

The Mesozoic era, which lasted from approximately 240 million to 65 million years ago, may be characterized as the Age of Reptiles because their greatest development occurred during this era. The first birds and mammals and the first flowering plants also appeared at this time. The Mesozoic era is divided into three time periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous.  


As we move back into time we enter a period in the *Mesozoic Era* that began with the first dinosaurs appearing on the earth and ending with the development of flowering plants. Humans wouldn’t evolve for at least another 136 million years.

Yet the scientific finds below suggest proof that advanced civilizations were visiting Earth’s past and walking at a time when dinosaurs roamed the planet.

 

**Cretaceous Period**  
 

**-** **Metallic Tube at Saint-Jean de Livet, France over 65 million years old**  
**Y. Druet** and **H. Salfati** announced in 1968 the discovery of semi-ovoid metallic tubes of identical shape but varying size in Cretaceous chalk.

The chalk bed, exposed in a quarry at *Saint-Jean de Livet*, *France*, is estimated to be least 65 million years old.

**Triassic Period**  
 

**-** **Shoe Sole from Nevada, dated at 213 - 248 million years ago**  
On October 8, 1922, the American Weekly section of the New York Sunday American ran a prominent feature titled ""*Mystery of the Petrified ’Shoe Sole*,"" by Dr. **W. H. Ballou**.

Ballou wrote:

&gt;""Some time ago, while he was prospecting for fossils in ***Nevada***, **John T. Reid**, a distinguished mining engineer and geologist, stopped suddenly and looked down in utter bewilderment and amazement at a rock near his feet. For there, a part of the rock itself, was what seemed to be a human footprint!  
   
Closer inspection showed that it was not a mark of a naked foot, but was, apparently, a shoe sole which had been turned into stone.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zui8gr22fnd41.jpg?width=267&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eee9271c95c70577d094e6d343745c36a5072908

 

&gt;The forepart was missing.  
   
But there was the outline of at least two-thirds of it, and around this outline ran a well-defined sewn thread which had, it appeared, attached the welt to the sole. Further on was another line of sewing, and in the center, where the foot would have rested had the object really been a shoe sole, there was an indentation, exactly such as would have been made by the bone of the heel rubbing upon and wearing down the material of which the sole had been made.

**Reid** got hold of a microphotographer and an analytical chemist of the *Rockefeller Institute*, who made photos and analyses of the specimen. The analyses removed any doubt of the shoe sole having been subjected to Triassic fossilization....

The microphoto magnifications are twenty times larger than the specimen itself, showing the minutest detail of thread twist and warp, proving conclusively that the shoe sole is not a resemblance, but is strictly the handiwork of man. Even to the naked eye the threads can be seen distinctly, along with the definitely symmetrical outlines of the shoe sole. Inside this rim and running parallel to it is a line which appears to be regularly perforated as if for stitches.

The Triassic rock bearing the fossil shoe sole is now recognized as being *dated at 213 - 248 million years old*. An obviously modern shoe, complete with stitching, and etched in time in ancient Triassic rock.

*What modern visitor was walking in our distant past more than 210 million years ago before the age of the dinosaurs?*  


[**Paleozoic Era Proof**](http://www.skybooksusa.com/time-travel/experime/paleozoi.htm)  


The ***Paleozoic Era*** is a major division of geological time, preceded by Precambrian time and followed by the Mesozoic era, and including the *Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous,* and *Permian* periods. The Paleozoic Era began about 570 million years ago and ended about 240 million years ago.  


As we move back even further in time we enter this period of the ***Paleozoic Era*** where life was evolving from primitive, multicellular, free-floating forms in the sea to advanced groups on land. The most advanced life forms at the end of this period where amphibians, insects, fern forests, and small reptiles. Humans would not evolve for nearly another 300 million years.

Yet the scientific finds below again suggest even more strongly that modern humans with advanced technology were visiting Earth’s past and walking at a time when the first life forms were just beginning to emerge on our planet.

&gt;""A few days ago, as some workmen were employed in quarrying a rock close to the Tweed about a quarter of a mile below Rutherford-mill, a ***gold thread*** was discovered embedded in the stone at a depth of eight feet.""

Dr. **A. W. Medd** of the British Geological Survey wrote in 1985 that this stone is of *Early Carboniferous* age between 320 and 360 million years old.

*Who dropped this gold thread in the ancient fern forests in a distant time when the most advanced life forms on the planet where amphibians and insects?*

 

\- Gold Chain from Morrisonville, Illinois, 260 - 320 million years old  
On June 11, 1891, *The Morrisonville Times* reported:

&gt;""A curious find was brought to light by Mrs. **S. W. Culp** last Tuesday morning. As she was breaking a lump of coal preparatory to putting it in the scuttle, she discovered, as the lump fell apart, embedded in a circular shape a small gold chain about ten inches in length of antique and quaint workmanship.  
   
At first Mrs. Culp thought the chain had been dropped accidentally in the coal, but as she undertook to lift the chain up, the idea of its having been recently dropped was at once made fallacious, for as the lump of coal broke it separated almost in the middle, and the circular position of the chain placed the two ends near to each other, and as the lump separated, the middle of the chain became loosened while each end remained fastened to the coal.  
&gt;  
&gt;The lump of coal from which this chain was taken is supposed to come from the ***Taylorville*** or ***Pana mines*** (southern ***Illinois***) and almost hushes one’s breath with mystery when it is thought for how many long ages the earth has been forming strata after strata which hid the golden links from view. The chain was an eight-carat gold and weighed eight penny-weights.""

The *Illinois State Geological Survey* has said the coal in which the gold chain was found is 260 - 320 million years old. This raises the possibility that culturally advanced human beings were present or visiting in North America during that time.

*How did this gold chain find itself left behind in Earth’s distant past more than a quarter of a billion years before humans had evolved?*  
 

\- Carved Stone near Webster, Iowa, 260 - 320 million years old  
The April 2,1897 edition of the *Daily News of Omaha*, Nebraska, carried an article titled ""*Carved Stone Buried in a Mine*,"" which described an object from a mine near ***Webster City, Iowa***.

The article stated:

&gt;""While mining coal today in the Lehigh coal mine, at a depth of 130 feet, one of the miners came upon a piece of rock which puzzles him and he was unable to account for its presence at the bottom of the coal mine. The stone is of a dark grey color and about two feet long, one foot wide and four inches in thickness.  
   
Over the surface of the stone, which is very hard, lines are drawn at angles forming perfect diamonds. The center of each diamond is a fairly good ***face of an old man*** having a peculiar indentation in the forehead that appears in each of the pictures, all of them being remarkably alike. Of the faces, all but two are looking to the right.

*Was this stone carved and left behind by a traveler from earth’s future?*  


\- Iron Cup from Oklahoma Coal Mine, 312 million years old  
On November 27, 1948 the following statement was made by **Frank J. Kenwood** in *Sulphur Springs*, ***Arkansas***.

&gt;""While I was working in the Municipal Electric Plant in Thomas, ***Oklahoma*** in 1912, I came upon a solid chunk of coal which was too large to use. I broke it with a sledge hammer. This iron pot fell from the center leaving the impression mould of the pot in the piece of coal.  
   
Jim Stall (an employee of the company) witnessed the breaking of the coal, and saw the pot fall out. I traced the source of the coal, and found that it came from the *Wilburton, Oklahoma, Mines*. According to Robert O. Fay of the *Oklahoma Geological Survey*, the Wilburton mine coal is about 312 million years old.

*What advanced civilization or visitor was creating or using iron pots in our past more than 300 million years ago?*  


\- Block Wall in an Oklahoma Mine, at least 286 million years old  
**W.W. McCormick** of Abilene, Texas, reported his grandfather’s account of a stone block wall that was found deep within a coal mine:

&gt;""In the year 1928, I, Atlas Almon Mathis, was working in coal mine No. 5., located two miles north of Heavener, Oklahoma. This was a shaft mine, and they told us it was two miles deep. The mine was so deep that they let us down into it on an elevator.... They pumped air down to us, it was so deep."" One evening, Mathis was blasting coal loose by explosives in ""room 24"" of this mine.  
   
""The next morning,"" said Mathis, ""there were several concrete blocks laying in the room. These blocks were 12-inch cubes and were so smooth and polished on the outside that all six sides could serve as mirrors. Yet they were full of gravel, because I chipped one of them open with my pick, and it was plain concrete inside.""  
   
Mathis added: ""As I started to timber the room up, it caved in; and I barely escaped. When I came back after the cave-in, a solid wall of these polished blocks was left exposed. About 100 to 150 yards farther down our air core, another miner struck this same wall, or one very similar.""

The coal in the mine was *Carboniferous*, which would mean the wall was at least 286 million years old. According to Mathis, the mining company officers immediately pulled the men out of the mine and forbade them to speak about what they had seen. Mathis said the *Wilburton miners* also told of finding ""a solid block of silver in the shape of a barrel... with the prints of the staves on it,"" in an area of coal dating between 280 and 320 million years ago.

*What advance civilization built this wall?... Why was the truth, as is so many of these cases protected and hidden?... What is the real truth about time travelers, modern humans, and modern technology in our past?*  
 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Hieroglyphics in Ohio Coal Mine, 260 million year old  
It is reported that **James Parsons**, and his two sons, exhumed a slate wall in a coal mine at *Hammondville*, ***Ohio***, in 1868. It was a large smooth wall, disclosed when a great mass of coal fell away from it, and on its surface, carved in bold relief, were several lines of hieroglyphics.

*Who carved these hieroglyphics more than 250 years before humans walked the earth?*  
 

**Devonian Period**  
 

\- Nail in Devonian Sandstone, between 360 and 408 million years old  
In 1844, Sir **David Brewster** reported that a nail had been discovered firmly embedded in a block of sandstone from the *Kingoodie* (*Mylnfield*) *Quarry* in *North Britain*. 

Dr. **A. W. Medd** of the British Geological Survey recently indicated that this sandstone is of ""*Lower Old Red Sandstone age*"" (Devonian, between 360 and 408 million years old). In his report to the *British Association for the Advancement of Science*, **Brewster** stated:

&gt;""The particular block in which the nail was found, was nine inches thick, and in proceeding to clear the rough rock for dressing, the point of the nail was found projecting about half an inch (quite eaten with rust) into the ’till,’ the rest of the nail lying along the surface of the stone to within an inch of the head, which went right down into the body of the stone.""

The fact that the head of the nail was buried in the sandstone block would seem to rule out the possibility the nail had been pounded into the block after it was quarried. This was a time where amphibians and insects were the only dominant life form on our planet.

*So who dropped this nail to have it eventually preserved in rock at a time more than 350 million years before humans appeared?*  
 

**Cambrian Period**  
 

\- Shoe Print in Utah Shale, 505 to 590 Million Years Old  
In 1968, **William J. Meister**, a draftsman and amateur trilobite collector, reported finding a shoe print in the Wheeler Shale near *Antelope Spring*, ***Utah***.

This *shoe-like indentation* and its cast were revealed when Meister split open a block of shale.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7mpd9n15fnd41.jpg?width=327&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08018f5c8a16b38ef8c188cb853b2a624a81b66b

 

Clearly visible within the imprint were the remains of trilobites, extinct marine arthropods. The shale holding the print and the trilobite fossils is from the *Cambrian*, and would thus be 505 to 590 million years old.

Meister described the ancient shoe-like impression in an article that appeared in the *Creation Research Society Quarterly:*

&gt;""The heel print was indented in the rock about an eighth of an inch more than the sole. The footprint was clearly that of the right foot because the sandal was well worn on the right side of the heel in the characteristic fashion.""

At this time in our planet’s history there was no plant or animal life on the land, even the most early types of fish swimming in the seas had not yet evolved. It must have been a very barren landscape that this visitor to Earth’s past saw as he walked the land.

*How did he arrive so far into our past?*  
 

 

**Pre-Cambrian Period**  
 

**-** **Metallic Vase from Pre-Cambrian Rock, over 600 Million Years Old**  
The following report, titled ""*A Relic of a Bygone Age*,"" appeared in the magazine Scientific American (June 5, 1852):

&gt;""A few days ago a powerful blast was made in the rock at *Meeting House Hill*, in ***Dorchester***, a few rods south of **Rev. Mr. Hall**’s meeting house. The blast threw out an immense mass of rock, some of the pieces weighing several tons, and scattered fragments in all directions. Among them was picked a metallic vessel in two parts, rent asunder by the explosion. On putting the parts together it formed a *bell-shaped vessel*, 4-1/2 inches high, 6-1/2 inches at the base, 2-1/2 inches at the top, and about an eighth of an inch in thickness.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hoj9eba7fnd41.jpg?width=164&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1797ed7a8e2b3f57bad78915b862722b0819ad1a

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;The body of this vessel resembles zinc in color, or a composition metal, in which there is a considerable portion of silver. On the side there are six figures of a flower, or bouquet, beautifully inlaid with pure silver, and around the lower part of the vessel a vine, or wreath, also inlaid with silver.  
   
The chasing, carving, and inlaying are exquisitely done by the art of some cunning workman. This curious and unknown vessel was blown out of the solid pudding stone, fifteen feet below the surface.""

According to a recent U.S. Geological Survey map of the Boston-Dorchester area, the pudding stone, now called the *Roxbury conglomerate*, is of Precambrian age, over 600 million years old. By standard accounts, life was just beginning to form on this planet during the Precambrian.

But in ***the Dorchester vessel*** we have evidence indicating the presence of artistic metal workers in North America over 600 million years before **Leif Erikson**. At this time in our planets history the was no life on land, plant or animal. The most advance life-form at this barren time in our planets history was simple algae floating in the seas. Yet somehow through time this beautiful work or art was brought and left behind and eventually buried and preserved in ancient rock.

*Did a time traveler from the earths future leave this behind in the hopes of later discovery... in an attempt to help ensure that the truth about time travel would one day be revealed?*

**-** **Grooved Sphere from South Africa, 2.8 Billion Years Old**  
Over the past several decades, *South African miners* have found hundreds of metallic spheres, at least one of which has three parallel grooves running around its equator.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ki1es6uafnd41.jpg?width=261&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0235bd2d43279b70961451543e7f32add3ecc93

 

The spheres are of two types

&gt;""one of solid bluish metal with white flecks, and another which is a hollow ball filled with a white spongy center.""

**Roelf Marx**, curator of the museum of *Klerksdorp*, ***South Africa***, where some of the spheres are housed, said:

&gt;""The spheres are a complete mystery. They look man-made, yet at the time in Earth’s history when they came to rest in this rock no intelligent life existed. The globes are found in *pyrophyllite*, which is mined near the little town of *Ottosdal* in the ***Western Transvaal***. This pyrophyllite is a quite soft secondary mineral with a count of only 3 on the Mohs’ scale and was formed by sedimentation about 2.8 billion years ago. On the other hand the globes are very hard and cannot be scratched, even by steel.""

The sphere with the three parallel grooves around it are too perfect to be anything but man made. The Precambrian mineral deposit where the globes are found is dated to be at least 2.8 billion years old. At this time simple microscopic cells were all that was alive on the earth.

But this is obviously not true.

Who created or left behind these magnificent spheres. Obviously man made, and stronger than steel, what was their purpose for the people who visited and left them behind in time?  


[**Other Finds**](http://www.skybooksusa.com/time-travel/experime/other.htm)  
 

**-** **Artifacts From AIX En Provence, France**  
In his book *Mineralogy*, **Count Bournon** recorded an intriguing discovery that had been made by French workmen in the latter part of the eighteenth century.

Bournon wrote:

&gt;""During the years 1786, 1787, and 1788, they were occupied near *AIX en Provence*, in ***France***, in quarrying stone for the rebuilding , upon a vast scale, of the Palace of Justice. The stone was a limestone of deep grey, and of that kind which are tender when they come out of the quarry, but harden by exposure to the air.  
   
The strata were separated from one another by a bed of sand mixed with clay, more or less calcareous. The first which were wrought presented no appearance of any foreign bodies, but, after the workmen had removed the ten first beds, they were astonished, when taking away the eleventh, to find its inferior surface, at the depth of forty or fifty feet, covered with shells.  
   
The stone of this bed having been removed, as they were taking away a stratum of argillaceous sand, which separated the eleventh bed from the twelfth, they found stumps of columns and fragments of stone half wrought, and the stone was exactly similar to that of the quarry: they found moreover coins, handles of hammers, and other tools or fragments of tools in wood.  
   
But that which principally commanded their attention, was a board about one inch thick and seven or eight feet long; it was broken into many pieces, of which none were missing, and it was possible to join them again one to another, and to restore to the board or plate its original form, which was that of the boards of the same kind used by the masons and quarry men: it was worn in the same manner, rounded and waving upon the edges.""

**Count Bournon**, continuing his description, stated:

&gt;""The stones which were completely or partly wrought, had not at all changed in their nature, but the ***fragments of the board***, and ***the instruments***, and pieces of instruments of wood, had been changed into ***agate***, which was very fine and agreeably colored. Here then, we have the traces of a work executed by the hand of man, placed at a depth of fifty feet, and covered with eleven beds of compact limestone: everything tended to prove that this work had been executed upon the spot where the traces existed.

*The presence of man had then preceded the formation of this stone.*  
 

\- Letter-like Shapes in Marble, Philadelphia  
In 1830, letter-like shapes were discovered within a solid block of marble from a quarry 12 miles northwest of ***Philadelphia***. The marble block was taken from a depth of 60-70 feet.

&amp;#x200B;

 

This was reported in the American Journal of Science (vol. 19, 1831, p. 361). The quarry workers removed layers of gneiss, mica slate, [hornblende](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornblende), talcose slate, and primitive clay slate before coming to the layer from which the block containing the letter-like shapes were cut.

While they were sawing through the block, the workmen happened to notice a rectangular indentation, about 1.5 inches wide by .625 inches high, displaying two ***raised characters***.

Several respectable gentlemen from nearby *Norristown*, ***Pennsylvania***, were called to the scene and inspected the object. It is hard to explain the formation of the characters as products of natural physical processes.

*This suggests the characters were made by intelligent humans in the distant past.*",conspiracy,Forbidden Knowledge Mega Thread  pictures  illustrations

The completion of the city is comparable to digging out a system of below ground chambers inhabitable for 20,000 people with just a hammer and chisel. It is suspected the city was used as a huge bunker to protect its occupants from possible natural disaster or war.

Amazingly, the community had accessible fresh water, shops, individual rooms, community rooms, tombs, escape routes, arsenals, livestock, and even a school sporting a study room.

A prehistoric, below grown, three-level, stone monument on the island of Malta is known as the [Hypogeum of Hal-Saflieni](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/arqueologia/esp_malta02.htm) and was uncovered in 1902.

Finding it was an accident: several laborers fell through a hole they were digging.

In addition, 7,000 skeletal remains were discovered. Unbeknownst to anyone is the time period Hypogeum of Hal-Saflieni was built, but it is made completely from megalithic stones.

To make matters even more strange, voices in the range 95 to 120 Hz can echo throughout the whole complex when a person is standing in a certain spot.

Essentially this means that women's voices often don't produce this effect in the same way that men's voices do.

If that's not strange enough, a man with a voice range at about 110 Hz, the whole dwelling becomes a room that induces trance-like states and appears to be able to stimulate the creative center of the human brain.

The dam was once close to being one of the Seven Wonders of the World and remained intact for over 1,000 years, in comparison to modern day dams that last for roughly 50 to 100 years.

Around 2,000 feet long, the [Great Dam of Marib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marib_Dam) was almost twice as long as the Hoover Dam.

In about 600 A.D, the dam collapsed and burst, ruining most of the agriculture system and turning the area into the sandy spot it can be seen as today.

**Introduction**

For many years there have been reports and rumors of a vast network of underground complexes and tunnels beneath the North American continent. Starting in the late 1980s, the American government has tried to deflect these rumors through a campaign of misdirection and misinformation. Disclosure of the [Greenbrier Congressional Shelter](http://www.bvalphaserver.com/ftopicp-480224.html) at White Sulphur Springs is a good example of this campaign.

To believe the existence of the Greenbrier complex was revealed against the wishes of the American government is the height of naiveté. This revelation was allowed to take place. The Greenbrier underground complex was no longer useful, so it was sacrificed to divert attention away from a much larger secret. In other words, a classic misdirection ploy.  


While I do not have complete knowledge concerning the extent of America's covert underground infrastructure, I do have detailed first hand experience with many sites near my home in Oregon. Based on my experiences, and assuming a roughly uniform distribution correlated with U.S. population demographics, the total number of covert underground facilities is in the tens of thousands.  


What follows is both a compendium of my observations, and a do-it-your-self field guide for those who wish discover the true extent of the American covert underground infrastructure.  


**Rabbit holes**

The covert underground infrastructure serves many functions. Among these are strategic storage of materials and weapons, clandestine research and production facilities, alternant basing for military personnel and equipment, surface environment control systems (atmospheric lensing, synthetic earthquakes, weather modification, civilian population control, etc.), and of course sheltering essential government personnel during time of national crisis or war. This list is not complete, it is only indicative of the diverse ways in which the underground infrastructure is utilized.  


It should be obvious that many of the uses listed above require both support from, and easy access to, the surrounding surface communities. I call these underground access points ""rabbit holes"", and they represent a key detectable feature of the underground infrastructure.  


It should also be obvious that many of these uses require the facilities to be interconnected by a network of tunnels. The construction of these tunnels creates surface evidence of their existence, albeit transitory.

From the perspective of detection, the transitory nature of the evidence makes tunnel construction less useful than covert underground access points, however as we shall see, the evidence itself is far more compelling.  


**Searching for Alice**

As previously mentioned, many underground infrastructure functions require surface access, furthermore many underground facilities also make use of above ground support such as electrical utilities, generally as backup for their primary supply source. These requirements pose a design dilemma. The underground access points must be well hidden, and at the same time, easily accessible to personnel and/or vehicular traffic. What is true of covert underground access points, is also true to a lesser extent for utility supply points.  


How do you hide traffic and personnel movement? By mixing it with a legitimate flow of people and vehicles, in locations already under government ownership or control. In rural areas, public parks and recreational facilities make ideal locations. For instance, at a public camp ground, who will notice if 20 cars go in, but only 15 come out? In urban areas, post offices and other purpose built government installations are used.

After all, who pays attention to the comings and goings at a post office? In other words, the underground access points are hidden in plain sight. This is both a strength and a weakness. It is a strength if nobody is paying close attention, however it is also tremendous weakness, since anyone wishing to observe the location will blend in to the general ebb and flow of activity. In some respects, rural underground access points are easier to locate, but more dangerous to investigate, since the level of human activity will be less.  


Another aspect of *rabbit hole location* is proximity to some useful above ground resource. For instance, a public zoo makes a good source of genetic material for a bio-lab facility. It should be obvious that a major metropolitan hospital would make an ideal source for human genetic material, as well as the perfect location to ""field test"" some new weapon-ized bacteria or virus. What is true of urban access points, is also true for rural access points.

Many are located near the periphery of major urban populations. A large water reservoir, or a public camp ground located near a major highway, are good examples of useful above ground resources. Rural underground access points are favored as utility supply points, since the supply is less likely to be interrupted in time of national crisis.

As we shall see, this last observation can be used to great advantage in detecting rabbit hole locations.  


**Urban rabbit hole detection**

The detection of urban access points requires both persistence, and a certain amount of luck. Quite often, it will be some apparently trivial detail that will be your first clue.

The following is a list of indicators that are cause for suspicion:

&amp;#x200B;

1. A post office parking lot full of cars, with only one or two people visible inside the post office.
2. Sporadic late night activity at a government office building.
3. Security that is out of proportion with presumed facility use.
4. Unbalanced traffic patterns. Example: people or vehicles go in but do not come out, or visa versa.
5. Facility size is out of proportion to traffic flow. Example: many delivery vehicles at a small government office building.
6. Utility services is out of proportion to facility size. Example: large electrical service supplying a small government office building.
7. Deliveries are mismatched to presumed facility use. Example: 40 foot refrigerated truck, or medical supply truck unloading at social security office.
8. Facility location is inappropriate for presumed use or function. Example: social security office located in an industrial district.
9. Facility construction and/or layout is inappropriate for presumed use. Example: office building with oversized warehouse style loading dock.
10. Facility staff size and/or type is inappropriate for presumed facility use or function. Example: large ratio of managerial personnel (business suites) to clerical personnel.

The above list is far from exhaustive. R

ather, the list is intended to illustrate what sort of details should be examined to *uncover a rabbit hole*. As can be seen from the list, many clues involve some activity that does not match the presumed use or function of the facility. Other clues involve a mismatch between the physical nature of the facility and it's presumed function.  


Once a suspected rabbit hole has been located, further observation is required to develop a profile of anomalous activity. Drive by the location at different times of the day and night. Keep detailed records of observations. Enlist the help of individuals who live within sight of the facility to monitor activity.

Does a medical supply truck show up every Tuesday at a social security office? Is there any discernable pattern to the traffic flow imbalance?

It is the details that will ultimately confirm the existence of a suspected rabbit hole.  


**Rural rabbit hole detection**

As with urban access points, it will be a mismatch between activity and/or the physical nature of a facility, and it's presumed use or function that will indicate the presence of a rural underground access point. In addition, there are several aspects of rural underground access points that appear to be unique.

Most rural underground access points employ a form of radiated electro-magnet field that functions as a wide area deterrent to birds, rodents, and insects. The purpose of the field being to act as a contamination shield or barrier for the underground access point entrance. Next, since rural underground access points receive less intense public scrutiny, their supporting above ground infrastructure is generally speaking, more blatant.

The presence of a well maintained home with around the clock human supervision of the suspected facility is common feature. These homes will have multiple satellite dishes, and/or radio antennas. Another common feature of rural rabbit holes is the presence of odd alpha-numeric markings on the reverse side of highway traffic signs located near the underground access point.  


The following is a list of rural underground access point indicators.

&amp;#x200B;

1. A well maintained branch road leading to a little used park or recreational facility.
2. Electrical power lines that are routed near facility, when such routing results in longer line length and/or routing over a natural obstacle (mountain, river, etc.).
3. Electrical power lines or substations much larger than visible local load requirements.
4. Large reservoirs that serve no apparent useful function. Example: not needed for flood control or civilian water supply, or that have larger capacity than is required for presumed function.
5. The presence of truck traffic on rural roads with no known destination, or inappropriate truck types for apparent destination.
6. A public park or recreational facility that is maintained at a level well in excess of other nearby facilities, especially if facility less well known or used than other nearby facilities.
7. Public facility personnel (park rangers, etc.) that are overly nosey and/or suspicious of your activities, especially if personnel occupy the site on a 24/7 basis.
8. Public park or recreational facility where part of facility is fenced off, or accessed by a gated road, or otherwise made inaccessible to the general public.
9. The presence of inappropriate or unusual structures and/or construction methods. Examples: small cinder block building with an electrical power feed normally used on major office buildings. An unmarked, but well maintained trail in public park. An old building (possibly abandoned) with a new door, and expensive lock.
10. People at camp grounds that seem out of place. Example: improperly dressed, or using inappropriate equipment, or having unusual accents (these are people taking a recreational break from underground facilities).
11. Well maintained roads that are not shown on maps, or follow a different route than shown on maps.
12. A noticeable lack of wildlife (birds, small animals, insects, etc.) in a location that would normally support a large wildlife population (see 1.2.4 preface).
13. Any of the applicable indicators listed under urban rabbit hole detection. Example: unbalanced traffic flows, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As with urban rabbit hole detection, this list is far from complete. It is intended to illustrate what sort of indicators to look for, when searching for rural underground access points. Again, all of the techniques employed in urban rabbit hole discovery are applicable to rural underground access points.

However, it must be stressed that rural access point detection and observation is far more dangerous. Not only are there less people to hide your activities, but a larger faction of those people who are present will likely be *rabbit hole* occupants or guardians. Failure to exercise due caution may lead to becoming an unwilling underground guest.

For this reason, the author suggests one or more of the following precautions.

1. Be very discreet in rural underground access point observation.
2. Always inform a trusted friend of your intended destination and expected time of return.
3. When possible, use a group recreational outing as cover for your activities.
4. Spread your observation activities over several months, at random times and days of the week.
5. Assume you are being watched at all times, and act appropriately. i.e. As somebody who is enjoying a day in the park.  
 

**Tunnel construction**

The techniques used for *covert tunnel construction* are very different than *civilian tunnel construction*. Covert tunnel construction makes use of a [boring machine that actually melts earth and rock](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_underground01.htm) (by chemical valence disruption), thereby forming a glass like tunnel wall. This has several advantages over civilian tunnel boring methods.

From the perspective of secrecy, the biggest advantage is that little or no waste material (rock, dirt, etc.) is produced by the boring process, thereby alleviating the need for above ground disposal sites. Another advantage is that tunnels can be bored through lose rock, sand, etc. or other locations that would be unsuitable for civilian boring methods (for instance, a river bed). Large underground cavities are also constructed using this technique.  


Covert tunnel boring produces several phenomena that are detectable by surface observation. These phenomena are transitory, and will disappear shortly after tunnel completion. However the presence of these phenomena is unmistakable evidence that covert tunnel construction is taking place.  


The method used to melt earth and rock employs electro-magnetic energy to disrupt the chemical bonds within the material. This method produces little or no heat as a by product of the melting process, and is therefore very stealthy. However it does cause the evaporation of water to take place at an accelerated rate.

Since the method is electro-magnetic, there is a certain amount of ""leakage"" radiation, and this is detectable by the odd effect it produces on surface water. In particular, the *water will appear to rise from the ground as wisps of steam*, even though the ground is cold. This phenomena is very noticeable during rain storms on cold winter nights. The steam does not rise into the air, as it would if the ground was actually warm, but instead forms a layer just above the surface.  


Another side effect of *covert tunnel boring* is a peculiar rippling in road surfaces. This rippling is very slight, and most noticeable while driving at highway speed (55 mph). It is more heard than felt. What sets this ripple apart from normal highway bumps and imperfections is it's consistency. Assuming a constant driving speed, the ripple is perfectly constant. In some cases, the rippled road surface will continue for several miles, without the slightest change in pitch or intensity.  


The ""cold steam"" phenomena is only observable while covert tunnel boring is actually taking place. However the ""road ripple"" phenomena will persist for several weeks after covert tunnel boring is finished.

These phenomena are best observed late at night.  


**Forty trillion dollars**

Despite an ever increasing tax burden, the roads and bridges continue to decline, the cities continue to decay, social security and Medicare benefits continue to dwindle. Today with both husband and wife working full time jobs, the American standard of living is less than 1950 when the husband worked, and the wife stayed home.

In 1950, most government buildings were somewhat dilapidated, having a ""well used"" look about them, while most American homes were modern and well cared for. Today the cities are full of shinny new government office buildings, and many American homes look dilapidated and in need of repair. Government budgets and deficits continue their upward spiral, while the American family is learning how to ""make do"" with less.

Consumer prices continue to rise and wages continue to fall, as the American dream fades, replaced with the nightmarish specter of advancing middleclass poverty. Inexorably, despite every effort to reverse the trend, American wealth has been systematically striped from the people, and transferred to the government  


Something has gone horribly wrong in America.  


For the past several decades, there have been an unbroken chain of government scandals involving over billing and multiple invoicing for items ranging from toilet seats to bombers. Inevitably the media portray these scandals as unscrupulous corporations taking advantage of an inept government bureaucracy.

Sadly these incidents are more pervasive than media reporting indicates, and the truth is far more ominous than mere government incompetence or corporate greed. When the clandestine diversion of tax revenue was no longer sufficient to satisfy the requirements, a second method was instituted. American jobs were outsourced to other countries, thereby allowing the government to repatriate nearly 100% of product and/or service revenue through the foreign purchase of American government bonds.

Since the early 1960s, the American citizenry have been the unwitting victims of government fraud, perpetrated on a scale so vast that it staggers the imagination. When figured in 2004 dollars, the total amount exceeds **40 trillion dollars**.  


What did the American government and it's corporate accomplices do with this almost inconceivable wealth?  


The government has *built a entirely new underground civilization* beneath the abandoned factories, tattered homes, and crime ridden streets that litter the American landscape. In this new society, there is no poverty, no crime or illicit drug use. In this new society, healthcare is affordable, energy is free, public transport is efficient. And you, the American tax payer have paid for it all, without receiving any benefit whatsoever for your Herculean efforts.  


As to why this monstrous crime was committed against the American people, is the topic for a future paper. Suffice it to say, you will not like the motive, nor the eventual disposition planed for you and your loved ones...

An international research group has applied methods of theoretical physics to investigate the electromagnetic response of [the Great Pyramid](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_piramide.htm) to radio waves.

Scientists predicted that under resonance conditions, the pyramid can concentrate electromagnetic energy in its internal chambers and under the base. The research group plans to use these theoretical results to design nanoparticles capable of reproducing similar effects in the optical range.

Such [nanoparticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle) may be used, for example, to develop sensors and highly efficient solar cells.

The study ([Electromagnetic Properties of the Great Pyramid - First Multipole Resonances and Energy Concentration](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/electromagnetic-properties-great-pyramid.pdf)) was published in the *Journal of Applied Physics*.  


While Egyptian pyramids are surrounded by many *""myths""* and *""legends""*, researchers have little scientifically reliable information about their physical properties.

Physicists recently took an interest in how the Great Pyramid would interact with [electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation) of a resonant length.

Calculations showed that in the resonant state, the pyramid can concentrate [electromagnetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_energy) in the its internal chambers as well as under its base, where the third *""unfinished"" chamber* is located.

&amp;#x200B;

[Propagation of electromagnetic waves inside the pyramids of Cheops at different lengths of radio waves \(from 200 to 400 meters\). The black rectangular position of the so-called King's Chamber. Credit: ITMO University, Laser Zentrum Hannover](https://preview.redd.it/gx0ll8msand41.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=698c7ba34e940c31ec0a28193ce4fb02a841bf1f)

 

These conclusions were derived on the basis of numerical modeling and analytical methods of physics.

&gt;The researchers first estimated that resonances in the pyramid can be induced by radio waves with a length ranging from 200 to 600 meters.  
   
Then they made a model of the electromagnetic response of the pyramid and calculated the extinction cross section. This value helps to estimate which part of the incident wave energy can be scattered or absorbed by the pyramid under resonant conditions.  
   
Finally, for the same conditions, the scientists obtained the electromagnetic field distribution inside the pyramid.

In order to explain the results, the scientists conducted a *multipole analysis*. This method is widely used in physics to study the interaction between a complex object and electromagnetic field.

The object scattering the field is replaced by a set of simpler sources of radiation:

&gt;[multipoles](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/multipole)...

The collection of multipole radiation coincides with the field scattering by an entire object.

Therefore, knowing the type of each multipole, it is possible to predict and explain the distribution and configuration of the scattered fields in the whole system.  


The Great Pyramid attracted the researchers while they were studying the interaction between light and dielectric nanoparticles. The scattering of light by nanoparticles depends on their size, shape and refractive index of the source material.

Varying these parameters, it is possible to determine the resonance scattering regimes and use them to develop devices for controlling light at the nanoscale.

&gt;""Egyptian pyramids have always attracted great attention.  
   
We as scientists were interested in them as well, so we decided to look at the Great Pyramid as a particle dissipating radio waves resonantly.  
   
Due to the lack of information about the physical properties of the pyramid, we had to use some assumptions.  
   
For example, we assumed that *there are no unknown cavities inside*, and the building material with the properties of an ordinary limestone is evenly distributed in and out of the pyramid.  
   
With these assumptions made, we obtained interesting results that can find important practical applications,"" says Dr. Sc. Andrey Evlyukhin, scientific supervisor and coordinator of the research.

Now, the scientists plan to use the results to reproduce similar effects at the nanoscale.

&gt;""Choosing a material with suitable electromagnetic properties, we can obtain pyramidal nanoparticles with a promise for practical application in nanosensors and effective solar cells,"" says Polina Kapitainova, Ph.D., a member of the Faculty of Physics and Technology of [ITMO University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITMO_University).",conspiracy,Study Reveals the Great Pyramid of Giza can Focus Electromagnetic energy

**from** [**ThothWeb**](http://www.thothweb.com/) **Website**  
 

 

This article takes a quick look at a controversial site in Illinois called *Burrows Cave.*

In 1982 a large quantity of epigraphic material was been found there by it’s discoverer, a gentleman by the name of **Russell Burrows**. What is claimed by Burrows certainly doesn’t seem to be readily digestible by *mainstream archeologists*, but that of course is neither here nor there.

It has been said that some of the artifacts found are somewhat reminiscent of the Davenport, Iowa, and Wilmington, Ohio, tablets, both of which are of *doubtful authenticity*. Feel free to read the article below, take a look at the images and draw your own conclusions.  


In *Russell Burrows* own words this is is account of how he discovered the cave having stopped to eat his lunch on a bluff that overlooks a valley. He stood up and stepped on the edge of a flat, round rock.

His weight on the side of this rock flipped it as if on a pivot and he fell into a pit below the rock....

&gt;""I found myself falling into a pit which had been secreted beneath a large oval stone which, as I later discovered, was fitted into the pit opening and designed to flip or turn over when stepped on. The unfortunate victim would fall to the bottom of the pit, the stone would swing back in place and the victim would be trapped. I was fortunate: When I stepped on that stone, I was in the act of turning, and the stone, instead of flipping over, slid off to one side and left the pit open.  
I do not actually remember hitting bottom; my next recollection is of hanging on to the lip of the pit by my elbows, in great alarm. I admit that I have a great fear of holes that I’m not ready for, because of snakes. But I found none. When I freed myself and regained my composure, I began to examine the pit and have a look at what was to be the beginning of the greatest adventure of my life... I sat down to calm my nerves, catch my breath and give the situation some thought.""

He found himself in a chamber, with a huge face on one wall, and continues....

&gt;""I did not have to be a genius to figure out that I had stumbled into something that just should not be in Illinois. I have hunted for and found many artifacts of the American Indians and there are many of their sites in my part of the state, but I knew then that this was not American Indian. The face I had been nose to nose with was different from anything I had ever seen. The nose was flat, the eyes were wide-set, and the lips were thick.  
Then, of course, there were all those strange symbols to consider. I had crawled under a ledge and was looking for *petroglyphs* such as I had seen in the pit. I had searched all the walls of the entire length of the valley, and while I had seen a few *scratchings*, I was not all that excited about what I had seen so far. Finally, I gave up on this last place, and decided to quit. In disgust, I tossed my small rock pick against the inside wall of the overhang.  
   
The rock gave out a distinctly unnatural sound: a hollow ring, not what I’d expect from solid rock... As it was now clear that a cave was on the other side... My first entrance was through this portal and into a tunnel-like passage which has a drop-off of about three feet just inside of the portal. I was met with a strong, musty odor. Not of decay, but musty.  
As I moved my head and light around, I saw a full human skeleton reposing on a large block of stone. It scared the hell out of me! Then I began to see other things lying there with those bones. I saw ax heads, spear points, and something else—metal! The skeleton was laid out upon a solid block large enough to hold not only the remains but artifacts as well.  
   
The *artifacts* include ax heads of marble and other stone material, an ax head of what appears to be bronze, a short sword of what appears to be bronze, and other artifacts which might be considered personal weapons. There were also a set of three bronze spears, the longest being about six feet long and the shortest about three feet...  
   
The skeletal remains bear several fine artifacts such as armbands, headbands and other such items, all of gold. ""

The cave is said to lie somewhere along the Skillet Fork of the Little Wabash River in southeastern Illinois.

It supposedly contains 13 elaborately ornamented burial crypts. It is unclear and a matter of controversy who, besides Burrows, has actually been inside the cave . What is known is that Burrows has produced hundreds, if not thousands, of curiously carved stones that he says came from this cave. And some of the artifacts allegedly were not of stone, but of gold.

It is claimed that Burrows sold off enough artifacts to unknown buyers that he was able to place $7 million in Swiss numbered bank accounts. According to Swiss journalist **Luc Buergin**, this money derives from the illegal sale of gold artifacts from the North American burial site.

Other sources claim that Burrows melted down all the gold and sold it as ingots. Still others question whether there ever was any gold in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Edge of the rock cliff, approx. 300 ft. from the entrance to the cave.](https://preview.redd.it/qgvlfiy57nd41.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b64ee2a503f14be2f866d5b6b73fcf632e59f035)

&amp;#x200B;

 

A bizarre collection of *artifacts* was found in a remote cave system in the American State of Illinois. The cavers who made the discovery encountered a derisive response from the first academic experts they approached, experiencing a lot of difficulty finding necessary specialists to help them document and identify the artifacts.

There were problems of site security, disappearing artifacts, as well as people bending data to suit their personal agendas. As the site researcher **Fred Rydholm** remarks: ""For this kind of research you have to be thick-skinned, brave or crazy!"" It’s one thing finding these things, its quite another to explain them.

In the United States the saga of ""Burrows Cave"" has been going on for many years. Over three thousand rock fragments, engraved with a variety of ancient drawings, hieroglyphs and script, were presented to the world by **Russell Burrows** in 1982, who discovered them in a cave system in Southern Illinois. The story of the cave and its contents is so strange, that it’s little wonder it has met strong skepticism.

Recently deciphered for the first time, the stone tablets tell such a wild tale that it will require quite a turn around to accepted history. I was stunned into disbelief when I first laid eyes on the Burrows Cave evidence.

This is no straight forward set of hieroglyphs but, an inexplicable display of several cultures, a huge library preserved on *stone tablets*, collected together and sealed in a cave *sometime around the first millennium*.

&amp;#x200B;

[Gold artifact from the cave, clearly showing Egyptian or Egyptian inspired marks on the gold.](https://preview.redd.it/dvkfnuba7nd41.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd5bde287b9fb60d6501337a7944d3b83aae9b5b)

 

The first photographs of the artifacts were forwarded to me by **Filip Coppens**, who writes about world mysteries in Belgium.

He had heard about my investigation of the anomalies surrounding the presumed hoax of Egyptian hieroglyphs in the NSW Hunter Valley. He was struck by certain odd similarities between the two finds and sent pictures of the carvings which depicted a wolf-headed god, similar to an ""Anubis"" carving photographed in the Hunter Valley.  


Certainly, the *Burrows Cave* boasts a few forms of wolf and jackal-headed deities, from *the classical Anubis to half human versions.* One of the Burrows Cave examples is executed in bas-relief, with accompanying hieroglyphs, embossed on a gold plate. However, there is much more than *wolf-headed deities*, the carved tablets display an extraordinary cultural array. There is a hodgepodge mixture of images and cultural influences which make the artifacts very hard to explain. Even worse, some of the carvings seem amateurish or dimly remembered copies of ancient Greek and Mesopotamian sources.  


Whereas, others involve a high level of skill and obvious knowledge of ancient cosmology. One of the images depicts a ""wolfish"" deity in priestly regalia, wearing a bishop-style hat decorated with a solar emblem. The deity has been identified as the god ""So-Bek-Ra"", who is so pictured on a temple by the Nile. The figure stands, as the lone representative of an ancient priesthood, against an advancing enemy army.

There are also many carved heads, mostly warrior profiles, wearing both Greek, Roman and Egyptian headgear.

&amp;#x200B;

 

Curiously, there are even images of ancient Amer-Indians wearing feathers and facial designs, some showing clear Meso-American style head-dress. Records of ancient travellers? Amongst them are many ancient mystical and sacred designs, as well as maps, pictures of ships and non-indigenous animals.

Astonishingly, one of the carvings portrays the cloven-hooved god **Pan**, holding his pipes and consorting with a nymph. Another stone (as well as an ancient metal coin) excavated from the cave carry the bold image of an elephant underlined with Hebrew characters.

Oddly, an artifact inscribed in exactly the same way was found on a pyramid-shaped stone in Ecuador some years earlier. Some of the carvings are meticulously executed in full bas-relief, some completely carved into the shapes of animals and deities, while other tablets were etched to render the designs.

Even a small collection of solid gold artifacts and coins have been excavated. More than just pictures, there are numerous tablets with coherent linear script carved on them. Examples and influences appear to range from Hebrew and Sumerian to Roman, Greek and Egyptian.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/8knl77jl7nd41.gif

&amp;#x200B;

 

In my correspondence with **Fred Rydholm**, the best theory I could offer, was to speculate about a colony of resourceful pirates, who in some distant time, raided and collected the strange quasi-cultural cache of artifacts for themselves.

Together with an associate Dr **James Scherz**, who helped in the study and documentation of the artifacts, Fred Rydholm found correlations between symbols on the Burrows Cave coins and coins produced by dynasties along the ""Silk Road"" between China and Rome, the most predominant being ""Kushana"" and ""Satavahana"" symbols.

(NOTE: The **Kushanas** once controlled a trade dynasty along the Silk Roads, uniting various ancient people’s in the days of the Romans. They disintegrated with the collapse of the Western part of the Roman Empire about AD 300. The **Satavahana**’s were a seafaring people who lived on the coast of the Indian Ocean and had large ships represented on their coins before they collapsed around 210-230 AD. This suggests the likely time period of early in the first millennium around or after 200 AD.)

Finally, Fred Rydholm was able to report a significant breakthrough with two young Florida researchers, **Paul Schaffranke** and **Brian Hubbard**, who were successful in deciphering some of the inscriptions. Schaffranke and Hubbard recognized them as being one of several ancient Etruscan alphabets which could be translated into ""street Latin"", as used around the time of *Christ*.  


The two Florida men were able to translate stone tablets from the Burrows Cave that the great epigrapher, Dr. **Barry Fell** and others, had insisted were gibberish and could not be translated. Mixed in amongst the *Etruscan script* there is also the added mystery of *Hebrew* and *Egyptian* stone tablets. These were also recently identified and are being translated by Dr. **Arnold Murray** of Arkansas and, **Zena Halpern**, a Hebrew scholar from New York. The Egyptian material is still being assessed. Over half a dozen professional archeologists and linguists have now examined the collection and have been definite in their support of the artifacts’ authenticity.  


At last contact, the Burrow’s team had dug out and classified an astonishing four thousand stone tablets. Another breakthrough came, when a retired engineer **Bill Kreisle**, found several of the stones recorded *accurate maps of the Mississippi River system as it appeared 2000 years ago*. Another map stone shows a river on the Iberian Peninsula (Spain) with the ancient city of Cadiz near its mouth. But, most astonishing of all, they have reported the discovery of several stone crypts, excavated from limestone deep in the cave system, containing a number of interred skeletons with jewellery, artifacts and statuary.  


The mystery people who left the cache of records are, apparently, themselves, buried there. The biggest continuing mystery of the discovery is, WHO carved all these message tablets and from whence came this hidden dynasty of bodies? **Fred Rydholm,** who works with and writes, for the retiring Col. Burrows, reports in his recent correspondence:

&gt;""Although I speak with caution, as it is still too early to say for sure, there are many indications that the bodies found in the crypts are the leaders of a colony of refugees from Ptolemaic Egypt, including a Jewish contingent from the Roman controlled Kingdom of Mauritania.""

**Dr Joseph Mahan**, founder and longtime president of the *Institute for the Study of American Cultures* (**ISAC**), has examined the evidence from the new translations and presents this interesting scenario:

&gt;""They were secretly sent to America in ships provided by the Mauritanian King Juba the Second and his wife Cleopatra Selene, daughter of Cleopatra and Marc Anthony. Included among the refugees were the Queen’s two brothers, who disappeared from Rome (and recorded history) in 17 AD, Ptolemy Philadelphus and Alexander Helios.""

The graves of these people have been the object of a comprehensive historical search for the past two thousand years. We appear to have an advanced and well funded group of priest/scholars who, with the ex-Royal families, escaped the Roman Christianization of Egypt and set off into the unknown somewhere around 200-300 AD. The engraved maps and their collected storehouse of knowledge, shows a deliberate transplanting of culture, perhaps to escape the religious persecution of the Roman Invasion of Egypt and establish a remote colony which could preserve the ancient records.  


Indeed, Dr **Joseph Mahan**, an archeological anthropologist who made a close study of the cave artifacts, reveals a detailed cosmology and religious lore from the cave material which is remarkably similar to that which survived amongst the Indian tribes of the area. The area of Southern Illinois and Indiana, where **Russell Burrows** stumbled into the limestone cave system, is richly endowed with the scattered evidence of several different early cultures which archeologists know too little about.  


There are log tombs, skeletons and artifacts from the Adena culture, which is believed to have developed around 500 BC and to have died out by 200 AD. There was the Hopewell culture, 100 BC to 350 AD.

A mysterious culture concentrated along the Mississippi, known as the ""Mississippian"", crystallized around 800 AD, and was thought to still be in existence when the Spaniards arrived. Researcher, Joseph Mahan, points out, that archeologists have collected evidence for fifty years of an elaborate and uniform *Earth/Sun religion*, associated with the building of flat top temple mounds, which spread out from the Mississippi in the later part of the first millennium.  


These *pyramid-like mounds*, which carried a permanent fire at the top, contained a variety of art, impressed on copper and stone, depicting animal-headed deities, crosses, swastikas, and people in ceremonial dress performing rituals.

Examples of these mound sites are spread from Oklahoma, to Illinois, Alabama and Georgia.

.passenger airliner. 

Were there:

The US media said it was a passenger plane with 80-100 passengers to discourage Iran, India, Pakistan etc. from sending their assets there. However, after Taliban posted video showing insignia indicating it was a Bombardier E-11A, the US media changed their story, admitting the spy jet part, but still lying about the captured CIA agents.

564,OperationMobocracy,evfqie,"It doesn't have to be US currency, but I guess my main interest is in unresolved cases of large volumes of counterfeit currency or long-duration resolved cases where the currency was being passed for years before it could be tracked down.

Are there any contemporary conspiracies about large amounts of existing currency being considered counterfeit?  It seems like anywhere I can get away with spending $100 bill, there's somebody with a pen or light of some kind checking it to see if its legitimate, and this is despite $100s having a fair amount of anti-counterfeiting technology built in.  So people seem actively paranoid about it, despite it being less likely than it was 20 or so years ago.

I'm vaguely familiar with the idea that North Korea was involved in a large-scale counterfeiting operation, although it was a denied accusation and it would make sense that DPRK would get blamed to deflect from some black op involving counterfeiting.

That being said, state sponsored counterfeiting of US currency makes a ton of sense.

566,onn747,evfmvs,"Justin Bieber was on Ellen yesterday to announce his new album release date, but was showing signs of something else going on.

At the beginning of the video, he keeps repeating the words ""thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you"" as Ellen is talking, and near the end of her sentence she sort of hand signals him to stop it, like she's telling him ""let me finish talking first"".

Then Justin changes how hes sitting multiple times. I don't know why he did this.

Then at 1:09, he laughs pretty obnoxiously at the comment Ellen made, almost like he's not entertained with her humor. They cut off his laugh pretty quickly with a loud laughing track over his mic audio. It even seems to be two laugh tracks, etched into one?

Then around 3:17 Justin kind of under reacts to her joke about her co-host being hot across the room. He says ""oh, wow"" and doesn't even bother to look across the room, like hes not very interested or entertained by her joke.

Now this is the part that really stood out for me, at 4:41 he starts tapping his feet, something he did not do for the entire interview, even thru all this fidgeting. This stood out for me because he seems to be foreshadowing his reaction to the gift that Ellen got him. Seconds later he plants his feet on the ground, getting out of the chair while acting super surprised. It's not a surprise to me that he knows what Ellen is giving him, but it's interesting to see him physically foreshadowing it. Almost like he's letting us in on the stage direction?

Last, when holding up the apron, he finishes Ellen's sentences and I don't know the exact way to describe this other than he seems so disengaged to this segment, especially at the end like ""whatever, I'll hold it up, oh we're gonna play a game? Cool..""

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I never thought that this talk show Ellen was real, but maybe it is so fake that Justin is beginning to get annoyed at that type of behavior in Hollywood, people acting like everything is fine and dandy when it is certainty not. Or maybe Justin has found out dirt about Ellen, or he is sick of being everyone's dancing monkey, because EVERY other time on Ellen he has been sitting sturdy, polite, NOT interrupting, and let's just say a ""perfect actor"". . Maybe thru this awakening that he's had he has come to a conclusion that people like Ellen are the worst part of Hollywood. I also believe all of these clues are extremely subtle because Hollywood producers know every trick a celebrity will pull. Like how Kanye acted before he went on his own Ellen rant.

I don't know guys, everyone in the YouTube comment section says he is having anxiety, I do not think that is the case. I think it is very hard to see what he is doing because if it was clearer, it wouldn't have been released... so Justin did subtle things to keep the show rolling, but sent a clear message to those who actually watch whats going on....

Do you see what I see?

Symbolism throughout Back to the Future seems to reference Biff Tannen as Donald Trump. The trilogy also seems to contain a plethora of symbolism/predictive programming/warnings throughout its run-time, including 9/11 and the JFK assassination, to name a couple.

:--:#Trump's connection to Nikola Tesla#:--:

On January 7, 1943 one of the world's most profound and influential inventors met an untimely end. Nikola Tesla died from a Coronary Thrombosis -- the formation of a blood clot within a blood-vessel of the heart. When he died, the only concern amidst the circle of his closest -- and much the same, those who also opposed him; securing his life's works; notes, blueprints, trial-studies etc. Well, as it would turn out, the one person to succeed in this task was none other than the uncle of our current president -- John Trump. So, little Donald Trump could have very likely grown up bouncing on his uncle's knee hearing stories of these wondrous and marvelous inventions.

:--:#Baron's Oddysey#:--:

In 1893 a lawyer by the name of Ingersoll Lockwood wrote a book entitled *Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey*. This novel details the adventures of a young but prominent aristocrat who lives in Germany by the name of Baron Trump. Say, don't we know a young but prominent aristocrat by the same name? He also lives in what's called ""Trump Castle"". Being stricken and wrought in ennui, is given a manuscript by a friend of his father's and written by a man called Don. Isn't that a coincidence. In this manuscript is a detailed account of a ""world within a world"". Which is only accessible via portal in another country. That country being none other than where? ...**RUSSIA!**    
Throughout the book little Baron Trump comes to discover 4 new worlds.    
1. *The Land of Transparent Folk*- The people here wear long black cloaks and hold large black fans to cover their transparent bodies. If they say something untrue the fan envelops them and the become opaque.    
2. *The Land of Sodopsies or Ant People*- Driven into darkness by an ice-age the people here were no longer exposed to natural light or sound and lost their hearing and eyesight. They developed a sign-language using touch.    
3. *The Frozen Land of King Gilead*- Everything here is mad of ice and everyone here has a very low body temperature. Their brains are ""Frozen"" thus causing cognitive response to slow. Actions such as processing information and making decisions takes longer. They dislike anyone with warm body temperatures, which they call ""hot-heads"".    
4. *The Land of the Rattlebrains or Happy Forgetters*- Everyone here only has a memory span of an hour or so. Heads are smaller because no memories are stored. They view this as a virtue since if no one remembers anything, then disagreements and grudges are virtually non-existent.    
I've made no effort to find connections with the worlds in the book and ours besides the lessons to be learned.    

:--:#Ivanka Trump's New Year in Paris#:--:

In the spirit of ""ringing in the new year"" Ivanka Trump posted a series of photos to Instagram of her celebration of new year's in Paris, France. Though these photos may seem like another meaningless ""celebrity flex"" to those who aren't ""in-the-know"", but to those of us who are, a number of these photos stand out and seemingly bare some aspects of significance.    

To detail a few of these photos -- all of which can be found on her Instagram -- I'll describe the photo and afterwards will explain its significance. They all seem to make reference and pay homage to the book *""Race Around the World""* and one or two seem to reference Project Looking Glass.    

1. Ivanka can be seen peering through one of the many telescopes mounted around the top of the Eiffel Tower. She's wearing a Black and white checkered/spotted coat and is wearing maroon-colored gloves. The reference to project looking glass is obvious, but the outfit she is wearing is the exact outfit the protagonist in *""Race Round the World""* can be seen wearing on the cover of the book.    

2. Ivanka is standing on the back-side of a massive clock. She is wearing a long-sleeved black dress. On the cover of *""Race Around the World""* the protagonist is in front of a clock also. On a page inside the book is an illustration of the protagonist stepping off a train wearing a Black long-sleeved dress. Another exact match in wardrobe.    

3. This time Ivanka is facing away from the camera atop the Eiffel Tower. She seems to be admiring the city below, or the horizon. Whatever the case the sky and clouds' colors were edited to match the sky's color on the front of *""Race Around the World""*. Once again she can be seen wearing her black and white checkered coat and maroon gloves.    

4. Both Ivanka and Jared are standing in front of a series of mirrors. Their reflections repeated a number of times. (Looking Glass? Or something I thought of; symbolizing the multiverse theory or multiple realities theory?) In any case the significance isn't in the photo itself but in regards to the caption which read ""Reflecting on the new year💛."" Who uses a yellow heart intentionally? No one I know. A number of people wondered this also and some digging was done. It was discovered that when referencing the color Yellow in the Color-codes for emergencies aboard Naval vessels it correlates with the letter ""Q"" and has the meaning statement ""My vessel is healthy and I request free pratique.""    

These subtle little drops/nudges are too frequent to be purely coincidental.    

**For example:** Melania wore a yellow dress with 2 or 3 flowers -- Hibiscus specifically, on it. Upon further research, it was found out that this specific color of hibiscus goes by the name of ""Perfect Storm."" Coincidence? I think not. Melania has also worn a number of other yellow outfits, such as a one-piece solid yellow suit/jumper with yellow heels.    

Though this ""proofs"" compilation began as a means to answer the question of ""Is Donald Trump a time traveler?"" i may lose a few of the one's reading this here, if i havent already because although unintentional, this is where it seems to begin to collide majorly with QAnon. But regardless of whether you subscribe to the theory or not, i find it just as compelling.    


:--:#QAnon Relations and Tie-ins#:--:    

The photos Ivanka posted to her Instagram were uploaded at 5:48 AM which seems to correspond with Q-drop 1317 which was posted on the fourth of May in 2018 (5 4 8) containing the words ""Racing Around the World"" in a stringer. The Q-drop in question was in regards to John Kerry secretly meeting with Iran to salvage a ""deal"". A stringer read *""Why is Hussein/JK traveling **WW** and meeting with foreign heads of state (some enemies of the US)?"" **WW** stands for **world-wide**. John Kerry met with Kamal Khazari of Iran -- in Paris of all places, while totally undermining the Logan Act which prohibits unauthorized negotiations with foreign nations, on May 13, 2018 -- eight days AFTER the afirementioned q-drop.    

:--:#Revisiting the Race#:--:    

Going back to the book *""Race Around the World""*, there's a page with an illustration depicting the protagonist in a room with a projector. Among some other pages strewn halphazardly across the floor is a drawing of a train that resembles a train drew by a man by the name of Charles Dellschau. Dellschau's artwork was discovered in a scrapbook of sorts containing many more illustrations, sadly only after hia death. This man drew many odd travel-vessel illustrations; all of which had the word ""Trump"" incorperated in some form or another. There was an illustration of an aircraft of sorts that was dubbed the ""Homer-Trump"". Strangely enough the train illustration ive been alluding to this entire time was literally called ""Trump Train"" and when you examine the drawing further you can see a little boy inside a window of the train who people have said mildly resembles Baron Trump, but when you take a look at the conductor it looks strikingly remniscent of none ither than The Donald. These are some scary coincidences to come out of some illustrations from the 1920's. I plan on further researching Charles Dellschau at another time.    

:--:#More correlation between Baron, Q and Ingersoll#:--:    

There was a Q-drop containing a stringer with the words ""An Ingersoll Jumbo Model Pocket Watch"". Well there's a watch company going by the same name as the author of the book I detailed earlier about a Baron Trump, called Ingersoll. Ingersoll's largest model pocket watch is called the ""Trump"". To make matters stranger the Ingersoll company was located at 45 John St. New York. 45?! Isn't Donald Trump the 45th US president, and oh, wait! Isnt John the name of Donald Trumps uncle who was gicen the task of securing Nikola Tesla's belongings?    

:--:#Conclusion#:--:    

At what point can the skeptics admit that coincidences of this magnitude and frequency can no longer be considered coincidences? Let's not forget the number of times that QAnon has warned/informed us of an event/happening days or even weeks before it actually occurs. Look, if not time-travel or something just as crazy then what? Something bigger than us is happening here.

Cohn, for example, happened to be gay at a time when that was not publicly accepted. So he spearheaded a “lavender scare” to actually hype homosexual people as particularly dangerous and haul other gay government employees before a Congressional hearing to be exposed- all while directing notice away from himself.

I looked into it, and there is indeed a tall bald, athletic looking black guy in a Lakers jersey, Lakers robe and basketball shoes walking around who appears to be at least 6'3"".

One thing I know about Kobe that makes him easily identifiable is his complete lack of a forehead, almost to the point of deformity.  It goes straight back above his browridge, almost like a neanderthal's.  I slowed the video down and was able to get a screen capture of him looking sideways at 3:24, and this tall, bald black guy in lakers garb has the exact same forehead, as seen in the main image below.

You can also see ""Kobe"" walking around between 2:34 to 2:45 and between 4:11-4:18.  It's perhaps worth noting that at 2:44 you can see him standing farther back and on lower ground than the people around him, while having his head still appear above the peoples' heads around him.

Before I get bashed - I'm not saying this is definitely him, but with some of the strange stuff surrounding the ""crash"", i.e. him being passed by Lebron on the all-time scoring list, the grammys and the old cartoon depicting his death by helicopter crash, it's worth looking into.  Some things, like the back of the dollar bill, are hidden in plain sight.

613,JStormCatcher,evd0ot,"A preface: I have been editing at Wikipedia for about 6 years now, and have not come across an article as biased as this.

There is an [article (take the time to skim through it quickly)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Posobiec) on Jack Posobiec, an alt-right Twitter user. Since it was created, it has been the subject of numerous disputes regarding the tone and neutrality of it. Each and every time a dispute has been raised, Wikipedia editors and administrators alike immediately congregate around the article and revert any attempt to make it sound neutral. 

For example, the [section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Posobiec#Political_activities) on Posobiec's political activities is quite literally a shit list which includes unsubstantiated claims. I attempted to convert the section from list format to prose format without making any changes to the claims, but was instantly reverted by [this user who accused me of whitewashing/censoring the article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jack_Posobiec&amp;diff=938057508&amp;oldid=938055805). Ironic, right? I didn't even make any changes to the claims.

I decided to bring the matter to the [talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jack_Posobiec#Bold_edit_rationale_and_further_discussion_to_fix_NPOV), where I could hopefully establish a consensus to make the proposed changes. One of the changes I proposed was removing [this](https://www.phillymag.com/news/2017/09/16/jack-posobiec-trump-fake-news/) article from the reference section, citing it as biased and heavily opinionated, and it was being used to present opinion as fact in the lead section of the article. When asked to explain my rationale behind removing the source, I provided two heavily biased paragraphs from the article in question. Take a look at [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/4n9GoTb.png).

See anything weird?

The two paragraphs I took from the article to demonstrate bias was instantly expunged by a Wikipedia administrator under the rationale of ""non-free content"". To this day the source remains on the page. You may take a look at the article and draw your own conclusions. 

Going back to the ""political activities"" section and the user who accused me of whitewashing the article. He [reported me to administrators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Edit_warring#User:CatcherStorm_reported_by_User:Praxidicae_(Result:_)) for edit warring, citing the ""consensus"" policy at Wikipedia. The consensus policy pretty much states that when it comes to editing at Wikipedia, the majority wins. And the majority of editors at Wikipedia are liberal. 

As a result of that report, I was blocked from editing Wikipedia by the same administrator who censored my comments on the talk page before. The goal was achieved- to prevent editors with valid and opposing viewpoints from challenging the bias on this article.

Here's the last thing I'll say about this. Take a look at [this exchange](https://i.imgur.com/XUirSUB.png) between an editor who supported the changes I proposed and a left-leaning editor. He refers to the biased sources I challenged as ""reliable"" and told the editor he was just ""making shit up"" regarding Pizzagate.

I have appealed my block and as of the time of this post I am waiting for a reply from an administrator. But it's abundantly clear here- Wikipedia has a systemic bias problem.",conspiracy,Systematic bias and censorship at Wikipedia  please take the time to read

&amp;#x200B;

 

As official videographer for the U.S. government, **Kurt Sonnenfeld** was detailed to *Ground Zero on September 11, 2001*, where he spent one month filming 29 tapes:

&gt;""What I saw at certain moments and in certain places ... is very disturbing!""

He never handed them over to the authorities and has been persecuted ever since.

Kurt Sonnenfeld lives in exile in Argentina, where he wrote ""[El Perseguido](http://elperseguido.wordpress.com/)"" (the persecuted). His recently-published book tells the story of his unending nightmare and drives another nail into the coffin of the government’s account of [the 9/11 events](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_911.htm).

Below is an exclusive interview by Voltairenet.

&amp;#x200B;

[Kurt Sonnenfeld and unidentified search and rescue specialist in subterranean void beneath Ground Zero.](https://preview.redd.it/ktl41hzl6ld41.jpg?width=399&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bdbcdeddde7207afd7ac58300370253f72e1507)

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Introduction**  


Kurt Sonnenfeld graduated from the University of Colorado (USA) with studies in *International Affairs and Economics*, as well as in *Literature and Philosophy*. He worked for the United States government as official videographer and served as *Director of Broadcast Operations for the Federal Emergency Management Agency* ([FEMA](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_FEMA.htm))’s *National Emergency Response Team.*

Additionally, Kurt Sonnenfeld was contracted by several other governmental agencies and programs for classified and “sensitive” operations at military and scientific installations throughout the United States.  


On September 11, 2001, the area known as “Ground Zero” was sealed from the public eye. Sonnenfeld, however, was given unrestricted access enabling him to document for the investigation (that never took place) and provide some “sanitized” pool video to virtually every news network in the world. The tapes that reveal some of the anomalies which he discovered at Ground Zero are still in his possession.  


Accused of a crime that did not occur in a manifest frame-up scenario, Kurt Sonnenfeld has been persecuted across continents.

After several years of fear, injustice and isolation, he has decided to take a public stand against the Government’s official story and is prepared to submit his material to the close scrutiny of reliable experts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Interview**

&gt;**Voltaire Network:** Your autobiographical book titled ""[El Perseguido](http://elperseguido.wordpress.com/)"" (the persecuted) was recently published in Argentina where you live in exile since 2003. Tell us who is persecuting you.  
**Kurt Sonnenfeld:** Although it is autobiographical, it is not my life story. Rather it is a history of the extraordinary events that have happened to me and my family at the hands of U.S. authorities over the course of more than seven years, spanning two hemispheres, after my tour of duty at Ground Zero and becoming an inconvenient witness.  
   
**VN:** You explained that your request for refugee status within the terms of the Geneva 1951 Convention is still being considered by the Argentinean Senate, while in 2005 you were granted political asylum, albeit, on a provisional basis.  
   
That probably makes you the first U.S. citizen in that situation! And no doubt the first U.S. Government official with direct exposure to the events surrounding September 11, 2001 who has “blown the whistle”.  
   
Is this what drove you into exile?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[With wife Paula, testifying before Senate](https://preview.redd.it/tdlnln1r6ld41.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2a60cf77629a89e59de0b08bb00c93af93d7e1b)

&amp;#x200B;

 

**KS:** A refugee is a person who has been forced to leave (or stay away from) his or her country for reasons of persecution. It’s undeniable that many people have been persecuted unfairly as a result of the quasi-fascist laws and policies brought about by the shock of September 11, 2001, and they deserve refugee status.

But the fact is, requesting refugee status is a risky and dangerous step to take. America is the world’s only remaining “superpower”, and dissent has been effectively repressed. Any person who requests refugee status on political grounds is by nature making an extreme statement of dissent. And if your request is denied, what do you do? Once you make the request, there can be no going back.  


Personally, I wasn’t forced to leave the United States, and I certainly did not “flee”. At the time I was still fairly oblivious to what was actually brewing against me. I hadn’t connected the dots yet; so that when I left in early 2003 I had every intention of returning.

I came to Argentina for a short respite; to try to recuperate after all that had happened to me.

I traveled here freely, with my own passport, using my own credit cards. But because of an incredible series of events, I have since been forced into exile, and I haven’t been back.  
 

**VN:** What type of events are you referring to?  


**KS:** I’ve suffered false accusations for “crimes” that demonstrably did not happen, abusive imprisonment and torture as a result of those accusations, as well as outrageous calumnies against my reputation, death threats, kidnap attempts and several other violations of civil and human rights as denounced by numerous international accords.

My return to the United States would not only be a continuation of those violations, but would be aggregated by the separation - perhaps permanent - from my wife and three-year old twin daughters, the only thing remaining that I have to live for.

And then, after the impossibility of receiving a fair trial for a crime that did not happen, I could be subject to the death penalty.  
 

**VN:** In 2005, the U.S. Government lodged a request to have you extradited, which was turned down by a Federal Judge. Then, in 2007, the Argentinean Supreme Court – in a show of integrity and independence - turned down the U.S. appeal, but your Government persisted. Can you shed some light on the situation ?  


**KS:** In 2008, the US government appealed again, this time with absolutely no legal foundation, to the Supreme Court, which will surely uphold the two already unassailable rulings made by the Federal Judge.  


In one of those rulings, it was also noted that there were too many “sombras”, or shadows, surrounding my case. There were many, many obvious fabrications in the extradition order sent here by US authorities, and, thankfully, we were able prove that.

The fact that there were so many fabrications has actually served to support my request for asylum. We were also able to show that we had been subject to a prolonged campaign of harassment and intimidation from US intelligence services. As a result, since my family has been assigned round-the-clock police protection.

As one senator has noted about my case:

&gt;“It is their behavior that belies their true motivations”.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Sonnenfeld and his family are frequently harassed, followed, and photographed, as shown in this photo.](https://preview.redd.it/gjpajmit6ld41.jpg?width=388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c15447311a67c61199b9fbfdb7859353c49fe2a)

&amp;#x200B;

 

**VN:** They want you pretty badly for a “crime that did not happen”! How do you account for such doggedness? As a FEMA official, you must have been trusted by your government. At what point did the situation capsize?  


**KS:** In hindsight, I realize now that the situation had capsized some time before I actually became aware that it had capsized. Initially, the false accusation against me was completely irrational, and I was totally destroyed by it. It is incredibly difficult to have suffered the loss of someone you love to suicide, but to then be accused of it is too much to bear.

The case was dismissed based on a mountain of evidence that overwhelmingly absolved me (Nancy, my wife, had left behind a suicide note and a journal of suicidal writings; she had a family history of suicide; etc.). The prosecution was 100% sure of my innocence before requesting the dismissal of charge.  


But the sustained incarceration even AFTER it was indicated that I was to be freed was what proved to me that something was happening under the surface. I was held in jail for FOUR MONTHS after my lawyers were informed that the case was to be dismissed and was finally released in June 2002.

During that time, an amazing series of strange events began to occur. While still being held, I had a telephone conversation with FEMA officials in an effort to resolve the issue, but I realized that I was considered “compromised”. I was told it had been agreed that “the agency had to be protected”, especially in light of the upheaval that was threatening with the implementation of the “Patriot Act” and the expected usurpation that would come with the new *Department of Homeland Security*.

After all the dangers I had risked, all hardship and difficulties I had endured for them for almost 10 years, I felt betrayed. It left a void in my soul.  


Because of their abandonment, I told them I didn’t have the tapes, that I gave them to “some bureaucrat” in New York, and that they would have to wait until I was released to retrieve any other documents in my possession. Soon after that conversation, my house was “seized”, the locks were changed, and men were observed by neighbors entering my house, though there is no record in the court of their entry, as would be required.

When I was finally released, I discovered that my office had been ransacked, my computer was missing, and that my tape library in my basement had been dug through and several were missing. Men were constantly parked on the street near my house, my security system was “hacked” more than once, outdoor security lights were unscrewed, etc., to the point that I went to stay with some friends at their condo in the mountains, which was then ALSO broken into.  


Anyone who looks for the truth recognizes that there has been an amazing series of irregularities in this case and that an appalling injustice is being carried out on me and my loved ones.

This intense campaign to return me to American soil is a false pretext for other darker motives.  
 

**VN:** You have suggested that you observed things at Ground Zero that did not tally with the official account. Did you do or say anything to arouse suspicion in this respect?  


**KS:** In that same telephone call I said that I would “go public”, not only with my suspicions about the events surrounding September 11, 2001, but about several contracts I had worked on in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**VN:** What are your suspicions based on?  


**KS:** There were many things, in hindsight, that were disturbing at Ground Zero. It was odd to me that I was dispatched to go to New York even before the second plane hit the South Tower, while the media was still reporting only that a “small plane” had collided with the North Tower - far too small of a catastrophe at that point to involve FEMA.

FEMA was mobilized within minutes, whereas it took ten days for it to deploy to New Orleans to respond to Hurricane Katrina, even with abundant advance warning!

It was odd to me that *all cameras were so fiercely prohibited* within the secured perimeter of Ground Zero, that the entire area was declared a crime scene and yet the “evidence” within that crime scene was so rapidly removed and destroyed.

And then it was very odd to me when I learned that FEMA and several other federal agencies had already moved into position at their command center at Pier 92 on September 10th, one day before the attacks!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

We are asked to believe that all four of the “indestructible” black boxes of the two jets that struck the twin towers were never found because they were *completely vaporized*, yet I have footage of the rubber wheels of the landing gear nearly undamaged, as well as the seats, parts of the fuselage and a jet turbine that were absolutely not vaporized.

This being said, I do find it rather odd that such objects could have survived fairly intact the type of destruction that turned most of the Twin Towers into thin dust.

And I definitely harbor some doubts about the authenticity of the “jet” turbine, *far too small to have come from one of the Boeings!*

What happened with Building 7 is incredibly suspicious.

I have video that shows how curiously small the rubble pile was, and how the buildings to either side were untouched by Building Seven when it collapsed. It had not been hit by an airplane; it had suffered only minor injuries when the Twin Towers collapsed, and there were only small fires on a couple of floors. There’s no way that building could have imploded the way it did without controlled demolition.

Yet the [collapse of Building 7](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_911_40.htm) was hardly mentioned by the mainstream media and suspiciously ignored by the 911 Commission.  
 

**VN:** Reportedly, the underground levels of WTC-7 contained sensitive and undoubtedly compromising archival material. Did you come across any of it?  
**KS:** The Secret Service, the Department of Defense, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of Emergency Management’s “Crisis Center” occupied huge amounts of space there, spanning several floors of the building.

Other federal agencies had offices there as well.

After September 11, it was discovered that concealed within Building Seven was the *largest clandestine domestic station of the Central Intelligence Agency* outside of Washington DC, a base of operations from which to spy on diplomats of the United Nations and to conduct counterterrorism and counterintelligence missions.  


There was no underground parking level at Seven World Trade Center. And there was no underground vault. Instead, the federal agencies at Building Seven stored their vehicles, documents and evidence in the building of their associates across the street.

Beneath the plaza level of US Customs House (Building 6) was a large underground garage, separated off from the rest of the complex’s underground area and guarded under tight security. This was where the various government services parked their bomb-proofed cars and armored limousines, counterfeit taxi cabs and telephone company trucks used for undercover surveillance and covert operations, specialized vans and other vehicles.

Also within that secured parking area was access to the sub-level vault of Building 6.

When the North Tower fell, the US Customs House (Building 6) was crushed and totally incinerated.

Much of the underground levels beneath it were also destroyed. But there were voids. And it was into one of those voids, recently uncovered, that I descended with a special Task Force to investigate. It was there we found the *security antechamber to the vault*, badly damaged. At the far end of the security office was the wide steel door to the vault, a combination code keypad in the cinderblock wall beside it.

But the wall was cracked and partially crumbled, and the door was sprung partially open. So we checked inside with our flashlights. Except for several rows of empty shelves, there was nothing in the vault but dust and debris. It had been emptied.

Why was it empty? And when could it have been emptied?  
 

**VN:** Is this what set alarm bells ringing for you?  


**KS:** Yes, but not immediately. With so much chaos, it was difficult to think. It was only after digesting everything that the “alarm bells” went off.  


Building Six was evacuated within twelve minutes after the first airplane struck the North Tower. The streets were immediately clogged with fire trucks, police cars and blocked traffic, and the vault was large enough, 15 meters by 15 meters by my estimate, to necessitate at least a big truck to carry out its contents.

And after the towers fell and destroyed most of the parking level, a mission to recover the contents of the vault would have been impossible. The vault *had to have been emptied* *before* *the attack.*  


I’ve described all of this extensively in my book, and it’s apparent that things of importance were taken out of harm’s way before the attacks. For example, the **CIA** didn’t seem too concerned about their losses. After the existence of their clandestine office in Building Seven was discovered, an agency spokesman told the newspapers that a special team had been dispatched to scour the rubble in search of secret documents and intelligence reports, though there were millions, if not billions of pages floating in the streets.

Nevertheless, the spokesman was confident.

&gt;“There shouldn’t be too much paper around,” he said.

&amp;#x200B;

 

And Customs at first claimed that everything was destroyed.

That the heat was so intense that everything in the evidence safe had been baked to ash. But some months later, they announced that they had broken up a huge Colombian narco-trafficking and money-laundering ring after miraculously recovering crucial evidence from the safe, including surveillance photos and heat-sensitive cassette tapes of monitored calls.

And when they moved in to their new building at 1 Penn Plaza in Manhattan, they proudly hung on the lobby wall their Commissioner’s Citation Plaque and their big round US Customs Service ensign, also miraculously recovered, in pristine condition, from their crushed and cremated former office building at the World Trade Center.  
 

**VN:** You weren’t alone on the Ground Zero assignment. Did the others notice the same anomalies? Do you know whether they have they also been harassed?  


**KS:** Actually there were a few people on two different excursions that I know about. Some of us even discussed it afterwards. They know who they are and I hope that they will come forward, but I’m sure they have strong apprehensions as to what will happen to them if they do.

I will leave it to them to decide, but there is strength in numbers.  
 

**VN:** With the publication of your book, you have become a ""whistleblower"" - yet another step on which there is no going back!

There must be many people with inside knowledge about what really happened or did not happen on that fateful day. Yet, hardly any have stepped up to the plate and certainly no one who was directly involved in an official capacity. This is what makes your case so compelling. Judging from your ordeal, it is not difficult to imagine what is holding such people back.  


**KS:** Actually, there are several other very smart and credible people blowing whistles, too. And they are being discredited and ignored. Some are being harassed and persecuted, as I am.  


People are gripped by fear. Everybody knows that if you question US authority you will have problems in some way or another. At minimum you will be discredited and dehumanized. Most likely you’ll find yourself indicted for something completely unrelated, like tax evasion — or something even worse, as in my case. Look at what happened to Secret Service whistle-blower Abraham Bolden, for example, or to chess master Bobby Fischer after he showed his disdain for the US. There are countless other examples.

In the past I asked friends and associates to speak out for me to counter all the lies being planted in the media, and all of them were terrified as to the ramifications to themselves and their families.  
 

**VN:** To what degree would your discoveries at Ground Zero expose the government’s involvement in those events? Are you familiar with the investigations that have been carried out by numerous scientists and qualified professionals which not only corroborate your own findings but, in some instances, far exceed them? Do you regard such people as ""conspiracy nuts""?  


**KS:** At the highest levels in Washington, DC, someone knew what was going to happen. They wanted a war so badly that they at least let it happen and most likely even helped it happen.  


Sometimes it seems to me that the “nuts” are those who hold to what they’ve been told with an almost religious fervor despite all of the evidence to the contrary — the ones who won’t even consider that there was a conspiracy. There are so many anomalies to the “official” investigation that you can’t blame it on oversight or incompetence.

I am familiar with the scientists and qualified professionals to whom you refer, and their findings are convincing, credible, and presented according to scientific protocol - in stark contrast to the findings of the “official” investigation. In addition, numerous intelligence agents and government officials have now come forward with their very informed opinions that the 9-11 Commission was a farce at best or a cover-up at worst.

My experience at Ground Zero is but one more piece of the puzzle.  
 

**VN:** Those events are nearly 8 years behind us. Do you consider that uncovering the truth about 9/11 continues to be an important objective? Why?  


**KS:** It is of absolute importance. And it will be equally as important in 10 years, or even 50 years if the truth still has not been exposed. It is an important objective because, at this point in history, many people are too credulous to whatever “authority” tells them and too willing to follow.

People in a state of shock seek guidance. People who are afraid are manipulable. And being able to manipulate the masses results in unimaginable benefits to a lot of very rich and very powerful people. War is incredibly expensive, but the money has to go somewhere. War is very profitable for the very few. And somehow [their sons always end up in Washington DC](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_bush.htm), making the decisions and writing the budgets, while the sons of the poor and the poorly-connected always end up on the enemy lines, taking their orders and fighting their battles.

The enormous [black-budget](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_blackbudget.htm) of the US Department of Defense represents an unlimited money machine for the military-industrial complex, figuring in the multi-trillions of dollars, and it will continue to be so until the masses wake up, recuperate their skepticism and demand accountability.

Wars (and false pretexts for war) will not cease until the people realize the true motive of war and stop believing “official” explanations.  
 

**VN:** What is referred to as the *9/11 Truth Movement*, has been asking for a new, independent investigation into those events. Do you think that the [Obama Administration](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_obama.htm) holds out some hope in this respect?  


**KS:** I really hope so, but I’m skeptical. Why would the leadership of any established government willingly undertake any action that would result in a serious compromise to their authority? They will prefer to maintain the status quo and *leave the things the way they are*. The conductor of the train has been changed, but has the train changed its course? I doubt it.

The push has to come from the public, not only domestically, but internationally, like your group is doing.  
 

**VN:** A number of human rights and activist groups are supporting your plight, not least Peace Nobel Prize winner Adolfo Pérez Esquivel. How have the Argentinean people in general responded to your situation?  


**KS:** With an incredible outpouring of support.

The military dictatorship is still fresh in the collective memory of most of the people here, along with the knowledge that the dictatorship (along with the other South American dictatorships at the time) was backed by the CIA, directed at the time by [George Bush Senior](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/bush/bushb.htm).

They remember well the torture centers, the secret prisons, the thousands of people “disappeared” for their opinions, the living in daily fear.

They know that the United States today will do the same thing if they consider it beneficial, that they will invade a country to achieve their political and economic interests and then manipulate the media with fabricated “causus belli” to justify their conquests.

Modern Genetic Research Confirming Cayce’s Story. This section adapted from Mound Builders: Edgar Cayce's Forgotten Record of Ancient America by **Gregory L. Little.**  


DNA analysis on Native Americans began in the 1980s, but with rapid technological improvements. research intensified in the early 1970s. Several teams of genetics researchers at prominent American universities have been conducting numerous studies. Although results from early studies showed the expected Siberian-Asia ancestry of the majority of modem Native American tribes, things took an unexpected turn in 1997.

At that point it was found that a small percentage of modem Native Americans have an unusual type of DNA then known to exist out’, in a few locations in Europe and the Middle East. Subsequent research indicated that the European DNA was no the result of genetic mixing after Columbus. In addition, the same DNA was later found in the hone of an ancient American burial confirming that people carrying this unique DNA had entered America in ancient times.

However, in July 200, this unique gene was also found in a small tribe living in the northern Gobi Desert area. The DNA research initially seemed to promise solid proof of not only where the ancient Americans came from, but also when they came. However as might be expected, ancient DNA research has become a highly contentious issue with several competing sides. Most of’ the DNA research on Native American Indians has been done utilizing mitochondria. Every cell in our body contains hundreds to thousands of these tiny, football-shaped organelles. The mitochondria process glucose (sugar) into a usable form of energy for all of our body’s functions.

The mitochondria are believed to be an evolutional form of bacteria that adapted into a symbiotic relationship with multi-celled life forms. Thus, the mitochondria have their own unique DNA, which is simpler and easier to analyze than the human DNA found in the nucleus. Mitochondrial DNA (usually abbreviated as mtDNA) is passed to offspring only’ through the egg. Thus, it is not a combination of male and female genes. It is a haploid gene — meaning that it has only’ one dose of chromosomes.

The haploid mitochondrial DNA shows only the female lineage of a person. Diploid genes are two sets of combined chromosomes, the female set coming from the egg, the male chromosomes from the sperm. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is categorized into several types and groups termed haplotypes and haplogroups. That is, there are variations in the genetic cycle of mitochondria that fit into clusters. These clusters can trace lineage far back into time. There are 39 different, distinct mtDNA groups into which all humans fit and there are variations on these types.

While mtDNA analysis is not only easier than other forms of genetic testing, it has a further advantage. All DNA mutates over time. But mtDNA has a fairly’ steady rate of mutation that permits a reasonably accurate estimate of exactly’ when a particular group of people migrated from their primary group.

Thus, two important factors can be determined through analysis of mtDNA.

&gt;First, a living person (or the mtDNA from the remains of a deceased person) can be tested to determine the specific racial group from which the individual came.  
Secondly, the approximate time when that individual’s ancestors migrated from their primary racial group can be determined.

One way to view mtDNA testing is that it may be able to provide a racial family tree extending back to the beginning of humanity. The current idea in mtDNA analysis is that ancestory on the female side can eventually, be traced back to a genetic ""Eve."" The 39 types of mtDNA were presumably derived from this Eve. Whether this idea will be completely confirmed by research remains to be seen.

However, mtDNA testing has confirmed several oral traditions passed down through many generations in several tribes. For example, the indigenous people of Hawaii and Polynesia have long asserted that their ancestors frequently traveled back and forth and that they 'shared ancestor’.

Genetic testing showed that these two groups were related and confirmed the migratory’ legends of these peoples.

**Confirming the Siberian Migration**

The first research on living Native American tribes showed they were comprised of four distinct mtDNA haplogroups called A, B, C, and D. This means that the Native Americans are derived from four different lineages.

These haplogroups were also found in native populations in Central and South America. Utter mtDNA research utilizing ancient remains recovered in the Americas validated these four haplogroups. Three of these haplogroups, A, C, and D are found primarily in Siberian Asia.

The B haplogroup, however, is found only in aboriginal groups in Southeast Asia. China, Japan, Melanesia, and Polynesia.  
 

**Confirming a South Pacific and Japanese Migration**

Based on the mutations found in the mtDNA, most researchers think that groups A, C and D, entered America from Siberia across Beringia some time around 35.000 B.C. Group B, they assert, probably came to America from the South Pacific or Japan via boats. It is believed the B groups began this migration not long after the A, C, and D groups arrived. However, the majority of the B group arrived about 11.000 B.C. This leaves open the possibility of several migrations by the B group from different locations.

It should be noted that a few geneticists have proposed that each of these tour haplogroups came in four separate migrations. And many Clovis supporters argue that all the groups migrated together.  
 

**An Unknown and Unexpected Migration Group Confirmed**

In 1997, a fifth mtDNA haplogroup was identified in Native Americans. This group, called ‘""X,"" is present in three percent of living Native Americans. Haplogroup X was not then found in Asia, but was found only in Europe and the Middle East where two to four percent of the population carry it. In those areas, the X haplogroup has primarily been found in parts of Spain, Bulgaria, Finland, Italy, and Israel. In July 2001, a research letter was published in the American Journal of Human Genetics, relating that a few people with the ‘X' type had been identified in a tribe located in extreme southern Siberia.

These people, called the Altasians, or Altaics, as Russian geneticists refer to them, have always lived in the Gobi Desert area. Archaeologists and geneticists are certain that the presence of ""X"" in America is not the result of historic intermarriages. It is of ancient origin. In addition, the 'X’ type has now been found in the ancient remains of the **Basque**. Among Native American tribes, the X haplogroup has been found in small numbers in the Yakima, Sioux, and Navaho tribes. It has been found to a larger degree in the Ojibway, Oneota, and Nuu-Chah-Nulth tribes.

The X haplogroup has also been discovered in ancient remains in Illinois near Ohio and a 'few’ other areas near the Great Lakes. It has not (so far) been found in South or Central American tribes including the Maya. The X haplogroup appears to have entered America in limited numbers perhaps as long ago as 34.000 B.C. Around 12,000 B.C. to 10.000 B.C. it appeared in much greater numbers.

It is important to note that not all Native American tribes have been categorized by mtDNA analysis and that relatively few ancient remains have been tested.  
 

**The Significance of mtDNA Research**

The mtDNA research confirms most of’ the other new findings in archaeology. The Americas were settled early and many different racial groups came. Several different waves of migration probably occurred. The initial wave seems to have occurred around 35.000 B.C. However, it may have been far earlier since some of the recent radiocarbon dates that have emerged from areas like California and the southwest point to 50,000 B.C. But it must be kept in mind that mtDNA analysis is still in its infancy. Not all current Native American tribes and very few remains have been tested.

But the picture the mtDNA research findings paint of ancient America is astonishing. It may’ seem that the apparent widespread presence of the X type (from Canada and Washington State, to Arizona, to the Plains, to the Great Lakes area) could indicate a wide initial dispersal. However, the history of several of these tribes tells a different 'story’. The X type in ancient America appears to be linked to the Iroquois.

This tribe, of course, was, according to **Cayce**, partly the remnant of Atlantean survivors from its final destruction in 10.000 B.C. The finding of the X group in the north Gobi-dwelling Altasians is hailed as proof that all American migrations came from Siberia via the Bering Straits, yet it seems unlikely.

With the X type being present in the Middle East, Europe, [the ancient **Basques**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_genetica12.htm), and America, *a migration from the Gobi to all of these areas is doubtful*.

The Cayce readings cite a series of large and small migrations of Atlanteans to very specific parts of the world. These migrations occurred at several times, but especially during the years approaching 10.000 B.C. One of these places was to the Gobi in extreme southern Siberian Asia.

If we assume that haplotype X originated from Cayce’s Atlantis, some of the X haplotype should be found in the Gobi region— but very little of this group should be found elsewhere in Siberia. This is what has been found.  
 

**B Haplogroup may Originate from Mu**

The B haplogroup, found only in aboriginal groups in Southeast Asia, China, Japan, Melanesia, and Polynesia, may represent Cayce’s [people of Mu](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_lemuria.htm). Both Chinese and Japanese archaeologists take the idea of Mu seriously, and the B haplogroup findings closely match the story Cayce told about the continent. Most of the people of Mu who escaped the destruction in 50,000 B.C. escaped to China, India, and Japan. Some time later, descendants of these peoples could have traveled to America.

While [**Cayce**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_cayce.htm) said that some people from Mu entered the Americas about 50,000 B.C., he did not indicate that date as the time period when the majority of them came. We only know that it was after 50,000 B.C. and prior to 28,000 B.C.  
 

**A,C,&amp;D Haplogroups – from Siberia?**

The Cayce readings do indicate that people entered the Americas from both the east and west in 28.000 B.C. These migrants came from [Atlantis.](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_atlantida.htm) China, and from ""across the Pacific."" The 28.000 B.C. date matches well with the haplogroups A, B, C, and D proposed dates of entry into America. The Cayce readings do have references to the Bering Straits, but Cayce did not relate that there were migrations across it.

In fact, no one ever thought to ask him about this, so it remains an open question in the Cayce story. But the A, C, and D haplogroups clearly originated in Siberia just as the archaeologists have speculated. Cayce stated that the ""yellow"" or Mongol race of humanity originated in the 'Gobi and gradually’ spread throughout Asia.

Thus, according to Cayce, haplogroups A, C, and D probably originated in the Gobi and would be the migrations Cayce cited as coming from ""across the Pacific.""  
 

**The Atlantean Haplogroup may be X**

**Cayce** indicated that the largest migration from [Atlantis](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_atlantida.htm) occurred just before 10.000 B.C. The majority of these Atlantean survivors went to the Northeastern coastal areas of America and Canada becoming the Iroquois. It should be recalled that Cayce also stated that not all of the Iroquois were Atlantean. The Atlanteans migrating to the Americas merged with the people already present in America by that time.

The Atlanteans became kaders of the tribes. Cayce’s story’ makes it clear that the Atlanteans had serious disputes among themselves that were reflected in ongoing violent conflict. (This was the struggle between the Belial and Law of One groups.)

This is confirmed by the Iroquois’ ancient history that tells of constant battles resulting in distant displacements of entire tribes to ensure their survival. Perhaps the most astonishing confirmation of Cayce’s story of ancient America is the presence of haplogroup X. What is known is that the X haplogroup first showed up in America perhaps 34,000 years ago, but its main entry occurred in 10,000 B.C.

These dates match Cayce’s timeframe for Atlantean migrations as well as the occurrence of X in the specific tribes predicted by his statements. The X group also appears to have shown up in ancient Iberia and in the **Basques** about the same time as well as in the Gobi.

These dates match Cayce’s story of the final two destructions of Atlantis and the resulting migrations to these areas.",conspiracy,DNA Analysis on Native Americans

In the beginning… there were many [myths of creation](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_mitoscreacion.htm).

Many of the great spiritual traditions told of how the material world came into being out of a nameless domain.

Some traditions have spoken of the 'cosmic egg' from which form emerged; or, as in the Old Testament, out of the dark and formless deep where the spirit of *God* moved:

&gt;In the beginning *God* created the heaven and the earth; and the earth was without form, and void; and darkness \[was\] upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of *God* moved upon the face of the waters.  
**(Genesis 1:1-1:2)**

The Hindu spiritual traditions of India speak of an underlying reality that is Brahman - a reality that is eternal and eternally unchanging.

The world of space and time that we are familiar with is known as *lila*, which describes our physical world as the playground of unceasing creative play within Brahman.

In terms of this cosmology humanity is indeed at play in the fields of the *Lord*. The ancient Hindu Vedic rishis told that the essence of all things in the material world belonged to *Akasha*.

A Sanskrit term, Akasha refers to the fifth element of the cosmos, beyond,

&gt;air (vata)  
fire (agni)  
water (jal)  
earth (prithivi)

The concept of Akasha is similar to the later western notions of **ether** \- a space field that contains all the elements within itself.

In the late 6th century BC **Pythagoras** spoke of the 'ether' as the fifth element of the world, in addition to earth, air, fire and water.

In more modern terminology we see similarities with the notion of the underlying quantum vacuum (or plenum, matrix) that is described as the energetic sea of the cosmos from which matter-reality manifests. The Akasha/ether/quantum matrix is the cosmic energy domain from which everything has emerged, and into which everything will ultimately return.  


Western streams of philosophic thought also speak of a domain beyond space and time.

According to **Plato** there was a realm of Forms and Ideas - a domain of Pure Forms - beyond our space and time, and that our material world is only an image or copy of this real, pure world beyond.

This pure realm was also spoken of by other Hellenic philosophers:

&gt;Pythagoras referred to it as Kosmos, and Plotinus as The One.

Perhaps the most famous illustration of Plato's thinking is his [allegory of The Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave).

In this allegory Plato describes a group of people who have lived all their lives chained up and facing the wall of a cave.

All they can see is the blank cave wall that lies in front of them. The opening of the cave is behind them, and the light that enters casts shadows on the far wall of the cave. Upon this wall, day after day, the chained people watch shadows move across as they cannot turn around and see the 'real' objects that pass behind them. Thus, they view these shadows as their reality and ascribe forms, reason, and life to them.

This is the illusion - the shadows from beyond - that we ascribe as [our 'reality](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_consciousscience.htm#Reality)' and give meaning to.  


Similarly, the Chinese sage **Lao-Tze** (or Laozi) spoke of all things originating in the Tao/Dao as the unseen root of all material things. The Tao is both the originator (the source) of all things, and the destination to which all things eventually return. It is the unobservable and nameless no-space, no-time, no-form essence that our words fail.

Are these non-spaces the realms where our gods dwell?  


Our myths may be the only threads that connect us with such realms; they are the narratives that remain in the earthly domain to help jolt our memories.

In his theory of [anamnesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamnesis_(philosophy)) Plato says humanity possesses knowledge of its past, only that we have forgotten this knowledge and so we need to rediscover the knowledge within us.

Plato wrote that humanity could only know the 'real world' in the form of memories. That is, human thought was really a form of recollection, and that humankind generally existed within a state of collective amnesia, having only fragments of recollection as reference points for reality.

Plato was suggesting that humanity had lost - or fallen - from an earlier state of heightened awareness and now had only traces of this memory in their collective psyche as a reminder. In ancient Greek, truth is called *aletheia* which means not forgetting; and in Greek mythology before the human soul incarnates into this world it drinks from Lethe, the river of Forgetfulness and one of the five rivers of the underworld, so that it cannot remember its divine origins.

Similarly, there is a Jewish legend that speaks of how we are struck on the mouth by an angel before birth so that we cannot speak of our pre-birth divine origins.  


Humanity is being told through these and other related myths that we need to learn how to remember - that truth is re-collection, not cognition.

We arrive in this earthly reality full of cosmic glory, only that we lack the key, the crucial guide, to unlock our memories and unleash the flood of knowing.

When we come across the scattered symbols and signs of truth, we inherently intuit and sense deep down some great significance.

Yet our minds are incapable of grasping the intangibleness of this hidden mystery. And that is how our lives play out, as we slip as souls within a playground of signs that are invested with ultimate meaning.

We need to find the [Arianne's thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne's_thread_(logic)) to help us through this labyrinth that we find ourselves in, and to remember that we have our origins in the Primary Imagination.

Our lives are not only unique creations but are acts of re-creation. They are attempts at entering once again into a lost remembrance which lies so far and yet so close to us.

The 13th century Persian poet **Jalāl ad-Dīn Rūmī** wrote that,

&gt;'The Truth is closer to us than our own jugular vein.'

And yet so vain do we search, as if we have fallen away from **true** **remembrance**.  
 

&amp;#x200B;

**Myths Lost and Regained**  
One of humanity's most enduring mythic narratives is what is commonly referred to as *the Fall*.

What this generally suggests is a break with - or fall away from - another state. This is often interpreted as a break away from a heightened state of connection and awareness; or, a disconnection from the living truth.

This implies that collective images and myths reappear in our minds, in our histories, as grand archetypes that serve as signifiers to assist humanity in its recollection of lost memories.

Touching upon this, **Carl Gustav Jung** wrote that,

&gt;Our psyche is set up in accord with the structure of the universe, and what happens in the macrocosm likewise happens in the infinitesimal and most subjective reaches of the psyche. 1

Here, Jung is highlighting the distinct correspondence between the human psyche and [it's synchronization](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_synchronicity.htm) with the grander universe of which we are a part.

This emphasizes the notion of the participatory mind, a concept that was known - if not articulated - amongst our pre-modern ancestors.  


It has been suggested by various psychologists that humanity resonates closely with the notion of the 'Fall from Paradise' because we carry within our collective consciousness vestiges of a remembrance. That is, we have a deep intuitive sense that we once belonged to something 'higher,' and to which we may one day return.

It seems that within our interior selves lies the hope of returning to something once 'lost' - a Paradise Lost, or some sacred state of communion.

This idea has been expressed in allegorical form in many tales, such as in this one, 'The Precious Jewel,' adapted from Eastern sources:

In a remote realm of perfection, there was a just monarch who had a wife and a wonderful son and daughter. They all lived together in happiness.

One day the father called his children before him and said:

&gt;'The time has come, as it does for all. You are to go down, an infinite distance, to another land. You shall seek and find and bring back a precious Jewel.'  
The travelers were conducted in disguise to a strange land, whose inhabitants almost all lived a dark existence.  
   
Such was the effect of this place that the two lost touch with each other, wandering as if asleep. From time to time they saw phantoms, similitudes of their country and of the Jewel, but such was their condition that these things only increased the depth of their reveries, which they now began to take as reality.  
   
When news of his children's plight reached the king, he sent word by a trusted servant, a wise man:  
'Remember your mission, awaken from your dream, and remain together.'  
With this message they roused themselves, and with the help of their rescuing guide they dared the monstrous perils which surrounded the Jewel, and by its magic aid returned to their realm of light, there to remain in increased happiness for evermore. 2

This allegory/parable, amongst others similar, reveals that a latent message lays hidden deep within us, and which acts as a chord of remembrance keeping us connected with something 'essential' yet forgotten.  


Mythologists **Joseph Campbell** and **Mircea Eliade** have both shown that one story in particular threads its way through nearly all traditions and myths - the story of a lost idyllic golden age.

This mythical narrative tells of the hero's journey to restore the world to its former glory and high state:

&gt;a tale of loss and the need for heroic restoration.

It is also a journey to reconnect ourselves with a sense of the sacred; to restore the bond with a cosmos that enfolds humanity within a universal sense of meaning, where the human psyche merges into the significant whole.  


Many myths recovered from the past, and from indigenous tribes, reveal a worldview of our ancients that accepted all things as part of a living, conscious, and sacred cosmos.

Within this cosmological view all life was viewed as connected with an animating energy that interweaved throughout.

As mythological researcher **Richard Heinberg** writes:

&gt;I feel compelled toward the view that our cultural memories of a Golden Age of harmony are the residue of a once-universal understanding of the spiritual dimension of human consciousness, and are at the same time memories of how contact with that dimension has been almost completely severed. 3

The contact may appear almost severed, yet traces of it have remained in various traditions, some more obscure than others.

This once bygone state that the stories and myths refer to as the Golden Age - or Paradise - can also be regarded as a metaphor for an evolved state of consciousness as well as a highly evolved state of civilization.

Humankind's state is that of having fallen into the grip of gross matter, and of having left behind a finer awareness of subtle energies. We have, as all major spiritual traditions commonly state, entered into a realm of separation from a divine or sacred source.  


Mircea Eliade, in his [The Sacred and the Profane](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/sacred-profane.pdf), writes that every historical culture regarded the human condition as being under a temporary spell of unnatural limitation and separateness.

Also, that our world now contains symbols and signs that serve to jolt human consciousness into some degree of reawakened awareness and remembrance, such as in the tale of the 'Precious Jewel' told above.

Eliade reminds us that in so-called 'primitive' societies the act of understanding the symbol can help to succeed in 'living the universal.'

Similarly, mythologist Joseph Campbell describes how the aim of ancient spiritual practices, tribal myths, and [shamanic teachings](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_chaman.htm) was to assist in recovering a lost mode of awareness.  


It is easy to conclude that the myth of *Paradise* (or of a *Golden Age*) represents an innate and universal longing, deep within humanity, for a return to a state of tranquility from which we have become separated.

Metaphorically, it may indicate that the inner being of the human, when in its natural and essential state, is in balance and harmony.

Perhaps there have been historical ages in which human beings shared a state of oneness or union with all life and with their environment, and that this peak of civilization was indeed lost.

The [Hopi legend](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_leyenda_hopi.htm) of the 'First People' talks of a time in the ancient past when people,

&gt;'felt as one and understood one another without talking,' as if suggesting a form of collective communion.

This legend describes a time when humans on the planet manifested a form of suprasensory perception, and where dialogue often occurred between various entities.

Anthropologist **Roger Wescott** writes that:

&gt;Moreover, most mythic traditions concur in asserting that, in the Golden Age, human beings associated easily and often with beings that were discarnate or only intermittently incarnate, ranging from awesome cosmic deities to playful local spirits. 4

Eliade, likewise, noted in his research that ancient myths spoke of a *friendship between animals and human*, with even knowledge of their respective languages.  


Eliade speculates that the shamanic imagery and/or visions of human transformation into an animal may be a metaphorical account of re-establishing a connection that was lost 'at the dawn of time.'

According to Eliade, the shaman goes into a transcendental state in order to 'abolish the present human condition,' which is regarded as a resultant state from the 'Fall' - and thus to re-enter into the natural condition of 'primordial man' as it was during the *Golden Age*. 5

Heinberg considers whether:

&gt;…paradise may be seen as serving a specific function, as a design for living embedded in the circuitry of human consciousness. All biological organisms, including human beings, contain elements of design…  
   
Perhaps we also contain within us a neurological or psychic program for the optimal design of social and spiritual relations between ourselves, the Cosmos, and Nature - a design of telepathic oneness and interspecies communion that represents the goal toward which our individual and collective experience would naturally tend to unfold. 6

Heinberg is suggesting here that memories of Paradise/Golden Age may not only, or necessarily, refer to a physical reality or time but serve to activate and catalyze human neurological and psychic functioning into continued evolutionary growth.

The memory, then, is not only as a remembrance of things past (as Proust would say) but may also function as a 'design' wired into us as a social and spiritual guide during dark ages - those times when our psychic, and thus also physical, states are low and separated from a sacred source.  


Similarly, various religious, spiritual, and indigenous traditions all refer to this rupture (our 'Fall') as a descent into greed, egoism, fear, and selfishness.

It is a state where the focus is almost entirely upon gross materialism.

Gnostic, Hindu, and Buddhist traditions also refer to humanity forgetting its true purpose; of how the distraction of, and attraction to, the physical world produces a continued state of separation.

Teutonic Norse myths state that a renewal of the world would only come after great destruction in which a period of chaos and disorder would arise that would see humans commit many degrading and tragic acts.

There are also numerous accounts in ancient and sacred texts that depict the theme of cyclic destruction and renewal, from biblical accounts, Hindu scriptures, and Tibetan narratives.

Our myths, stories, and narratives may serve to remind us of where we have been, and to where we need to return.

Yet can we rely solely on the old myths, or,

&gt;Are we now in need of new mythologies?  
   
After all, where did all the gods go?

&amp;#x200B;

**New Mythologies**  


It has been said that our old gods are dead or dying.

The many gods of times past were abandoned in favor of *the one god concept* with the rise of [monotheistic religions](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/mistic/religionsplanetearth.htm). With this shift away from multiple gods - which played a more direct, intervening role in human affairs - a more individualized sense of self and self-consciousness began to emerge.

The spiritual focus was now not on the interaction with multiple gods but of a relation with a single source that was transcendent and beyond the lowly human. Humanity no longer played ball together with their *godly caretakers*.

The human psyche slowly became separated from a close communion with the gods. This psychic bond, or participation, between cosmic forces and the human soul gradually became severed, leaving the individual more to their own devices and further away from a 'far off' god.  


This break from the interventionist gods is likely to have played a role in the shift of human consciousness more towards its own self-involvement, which amplified the presence and dominance of the ego.

Along with this shift came the art of personal reflection, and the manifestation of individual thinking.

This can be seen in the external transition from ancient Egyptian spiritual traditions to the human philosophy of the Greeks. This marked a shift toward knowledge as grasped by the human mind, and thus led to the increased belief that no gods were needed to understand such lofty concepts.

Divinity, the realm of the gods, became a place to which certain elite human minds could broker access. This was seen as liberating the human soul from the direct and all-powerful influence of the gods in daily life.

A new independence arose within the life of humanity that preceded an era of increasing human autonomy at play within a material world. The human being was now born into an environment where the gods had withdrawn.

Humanity was now left to stand on its own spiritual feet, and to learn to navigate through a world given over to them by their gods. And yet it was precisely this kind of environment which made it possible for an individual human being to develop a sense of full responsibility for their own behavior and spiritual state.

The soul life of the human had now become their own task to contend with, and could no longer be seen as under the sway of external transcendental forces.

Although this shift placed the onus of development upon the human self, it also dissolved the reciprocal understanding between human and cosmos.  


By defining ourselves *independent of the gods* we also defined ourselves as similarly being separated from Nature.

This process of separation between our interior and exterior lives was drawn out over centuries, and further exacerbated through orthodox religious thinking, scientific rationalism, Cartesian philosophy, and attitudes to the human body.

We are now coming to the end of the influence of the [Greco-Roman/Judeo-Christian era](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_biblianazar.htm).

As philosopher **Jeremy Naydler** notes:

&gt;It has achieved its purpose, which was to make us more individuated, more self- rather than god-centered in our soul-life, and thus more free.  
   
But now there is a need to become aware again of inner, spiritual realities, but to become aware of them grounded in our own sense of self and with a clear and discriminating intelligence with which we can once more turn toward them. 7

Individual selfhood came at a great cost.

In fact, it could only come about when the previous gods had faded from human consciousness. And yet from this came the emergence of [self-consciousness](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_consciousuniverse.htm), the focus on individual selfhood, and the possibility for self-transcendence through individual inner work. That is, to take the path back toward a cosmic, sacred communion through self-volition and individual choice.

This path *back to the gods* (the sacred source) does not imply 'going out' there - to reach them in some realm beyond - but rather suggests allowing them back into the human psyche.

This means receiving the sacred connection once again within the inner life/self of the human. We could phrase it as bringing the sacred impulse back down into material life - the re-sacralization of the material plane.

It could be said that human destiny is to *know the infinite without leaving the finite* \- both exist simultaneously and both are necessary.  


Spirit is not recognized by it being something other than the material, but by overcoming its otherness. It is implicit within all material forms, and is in communion with all entities. In the sacred traditions spirit is a living recognition, not an inanimate one. That is, sacred spirit wishes to be known beyond its otherness.

Our multiple gods, as depth psychology informs us, also represent aspects of the human psyche.

Astrology places a similar pattern upon the planets, as their alignment influences psychic correspondences and can affect the human physically, mentally, and emotionally. In some of the most ancient spiritual traditions that came out of [Egypt](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_egipto.htm) and [Mesopotamia](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sumer_annunaki.htm) thousands of years ago, the realm of Spirit existed in a transcendental pure form beyond matter.

It was human destiny for the privileged capable few to ascend through rigorous trial and initiation toward this otherworld and seek a connection with it so that it may manifest through them upon the material plane.

Hence such cultures were star-orientated as this represented a source beyond the terrestrial earth. In more modern times, the implication has shifted to a view that sees Spirit as having its destiny to become implicated in matter.

Together, spirit and matter form the necessary communion.

The re-spiritualization - the re-sacralization - of the material world must come about through humanity's involvement. The human must embrace the cosmos within themselves, and to bring it 'down to earth,' so to speak.

This is now a mass endeavor, which suggests that the time for the elite special few initiates is over. In other words, where once a 'higher' state of consciousness was first developed through exceptional individuals, it is now to be developed through the mass by receptive individuals and communities connecting together across physical and temporal boundaries.  


A re-sacralization is required on a global scale - a sacred revival for our times - this very thing may be brought into play within our global civilization if we transition to a genuine relationship with our developing technologies.

Likewise, the natural world is not an obstacle that needs to be overcome if we are to strive towards a sacred communion and understanding.

On the contrary, the natural world is itself the playground upon which sacred energies move through, and within which lies the soul of the world. The old mythologies placed the gods within the supernatural world, where Nature was something to move through and beyond. Yet the old mythologies are no longer with us for they no longer serve the same purpose.

They too have been transcended for we are in a different era - an altogether different temporal and spatial state.

The old mythological world of archetypal energies has now been fused into an order where the supernatural, the natural, and the human mind-soul merge together.

We are participating in bringing the sacred back into the material realm - in bringing the gods back home!

The sacred source is to be encountered through ourselves and not within another world; through normal human consciousness rather than its denial.

We can say that,

&gt;'humanity has entered a new stage in the unfolding cosmological drama, and that this stage is to do with the infinite rediscovering itself within the sphere of the finite.' 8

From these ashes a new mythology must arise, one that has been gestating within the inner reaches of humankind for some time already.

It has been suggested that we are in a battle for the Western soul, as we have been largely sleeping through crisis after crisis of the spirit. A new mythology is rapidly becoming both a social and spiritual necessity, as our old frameworks and worldviews dissolve from usefulness.

Mythologies have the power to conduct and guide us through our lifetimes, as a companion upon the psycho-spiritual journey of transformation.

A mythology is a set of figures and symbols that can reflect and shape a state of mind; they can serve as a perceptual framework. They can be our filters and our friends, but they neither belong to us nor any particular locale.

They are available for everyone, and are beyond the individual mind.

According to **Joseph Campbell**, arguably one of the most respected mythologists of the 20th century,

&gt;The life of a mythology derives from the vitality of its symbols as metaphors delivering, not simply the idea, but a sense of actual participation in such a realization of transcendence, infinity, and abundance…  
   
The first and most essential service of a mythology is this one, of opening the mind and heart to the utter wonder of all being, and the second service, then, is cosmological:  
of representing the universe and whole spectacle of nature, both as known to the mind and as beheld by the eye…9

Mythology then should serve to assist participation in our own transcendence amid the spectacle of the cosmos.

Unfortunately, it is when mythologies become locked-in as social, political, and [religious control systems](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/mistic/religionsplanetearth.htm) that the human developmental path becomes distorted and muddy underfoot.  


Myths emphasize commonality and offer us a transcendental communion, if we don't corrupt them into further mental prisons.

It is essential therefore that the new mythologies for a sacred revival inspire within humanity a wish for interiorizing the cosmological impulse that is pervasive and which irradiates our reality.

It's all a lie.

History is being rewritten daily thanks to alternative media news sources bringing to light the mass propaganda of false history and disclosing truths hidden for decades and centuries.

My son's 3rd grade class was discussing [**Columbus**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_colon.htm) in class this week. I pick him up each day to ""deprogram"" him from the public indoctrination system. When I asked him what he had learned about Mr. Columbus, he said that school taught that one of his ships had sunk off an island.

I said, ""that's it?"" and he said ""yes"".

I then looked at his homework and it included the Scholastic magazine which featured Columbus and sure enough, the article only said he had made it only to an island name Haiti. Over a dozen states no longer recognize Columbus Day, a creation of the Knights of Columbus back in 1934.

Even edgy [Mainstream whorporate news](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_mediacontrol.htm) is revising history now as truths become known as to the barbaric history of our country's ""founding"" when we genocided *over 97% of the Indian population* in conquest and brought millions of slaves across the Atlantic to work in the cotton and tobacco fields of the wealthy with names like Jefferson, Washington, Adams, etc.

This is 24/7 Wall St.'s list of the richest U.S. presidents:

&gt;**George Washington**, first president from 1789 to 1797  
 \- Net worth: $525 million In office  
His Virginia plantation, Mount Vernon, consisted of five separate farms on 8,000 acres of prime farmland, run by more than 300 slaves. His wife, Martha Washington, inherited significant property from her father. Washington made well more than subsequent presidents: his salary was 2% of the total U.S. budget in 1789.  
   
**Thomas Jefferson**, third president from 1801 to 1809  
 \- Net worth: $212 million  
Jefferson was left 3,000 acres and several dozen slaves by his father. Monticello, his home on a 5,000-acre plantation in Virginia, was one of the architectural wonders of its time. He made considerable money in various political positions before becoming president, but was mired in debt towards the end of his life.  
   
**James Madison**, fourth president from 1809 to 1817  
 \- Net worth: $101 million  
Madison was the largest landowner in Orange County, Va. His land holding consisted of 5,000 acres and the Montpelier estate. He made significant wealth as Secretary of State and president. Madison lost money at the end of his life due to the steady financial collapse of his plantation.Additionally, all these men had slaves, even until death. In fact, Thomas Jefferson pledged his slaves as assets upon his death against the massive debt he had incurred. ([source](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/02/16/richest-usa-presidents/1923739/))

Now these richest of the new country land baron's of the time were really interested in freedom for all of We the People as they pushed natives into reservations on the worst land possible and took slaves willingly to run their business'?

When they were done with the ""most important document in history"", the U.S. Constitution, they gave rights to only 7% of the population; White, Male and Puritan land owners. It took 75 years later for minorities to even get the right to vote and 120 years for women and now corporations of the wealthy run this country.

The truth is the barbaric ways of old Europe just morphed into new overlords who broke away from the King and Church to form their own Kingdoms and used deception and fraud to sell it to the masses.

My country 'tis of thee…

**The Hidden History of the Promised Land**

[**Source**](http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=239)

It may sound a little over the top but it's really no overstatement to say that much in our modern world is based on falsehood and fabrication.

We are told, for example, that Columbus 'discovered' America in 1492, yet there is plenty of evidence to suggest that others had visited America before Columbus:

&gt;including visitors from ancient Egypt, Phoenicia and medieval Europe.

Despite this modern authorities continue to push the line that ""Columbus discovered America.""

In point of fact *Columbus* *himself never even set eyes upon America*; the closest he got to the mainland of North America was Puerto Rico. However in the aftermath of Columbus's voyage John Cabot sailed from Bristol, England, which in turn opened the way for the first colony in Jamestown, Virginia and thus allowed the English to claim America as their own.

Yet there is considerable evidence that suggests that others from different cultures preceded Cabot and Columbus.

So one is forced to ask:

&gt;Why, when there is much to suggest that others from different cultures preceded Columbus, don't we hear more about this possibility being investigated?  
Could it be that certain powers have a vested interest in keeping our real history under wraps?

Whatever the answer the fact remains that a great deal has been unearthed which is completely at odds with conventional notions regarding the origins of what we know today as America.

In fact according to some contemporary authorities, the Native Americans encountered by the early settlers from England were not what they appeared to be.

They were indeed native to the Americas but they were not its original inhabitants, who according to various tribal legends, had disappeared eons before in a series of cataclysms.

**Columbus** **Day? True Legacy - Cruelty and Slavery**

Once again, it's time to celebrate Columbus Day. Yet, the stunning truth is: If [Christopher Columbus](http://www.creators.com/liberal/norman-solomon.html) were alive today, he would be put on trial for crimes against humanity.

[Columbus' reign of terror](http://hubpages.com/hub/Christopher-Columbus), as documented by noted historians, was so bloody, his [legacy so unspeakably cruel](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/History/Hero-making_LMTTM.html), that Columbus makes a modern villain like Saddam Hussein look like a pale codfish.

Question: Why do we honor a man who, if he were alive today, would almost certainly be sitting on Death Row awaiting execution?

If you'd like to know [the true story](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7D91031F937A35752C1A96F948260) about Christopher Columbus, please read on. But I warn you, it's not for the faint of heart.

Here's the basics. On the second Monday in October each year, we celebrate Columbus Day (this year, it's on October 11th). We teach our school kids a cute little song that goes: ""In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue."" It's an American tradition, as American as pizza pie. Or is it? Surprisingly, the true story of Christopher Columbus has very little in common with the myth we all learned in school.

[Columbus Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_day), as we know it in the United States, was invented by the [Knights of Columbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_day#United_States_observance), a Catholic fraternal service organization. Back in the 1930s, they were looking for a Catholic hero as a role-model their kids could look up to. In 1934, as a result of lobbying by the Knights of Columbus, Congress and President Franklin Roosevelt signed Columbus Day into law as a federal holiday to honor this courageous explorer.

Or so we thought...

There are several problems with this. First of all, Columbus wasn't the first European to discover America. As we all know, the Viking, [Leif Ericson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lief_Erikson) probably founded a Norse village on Newfoundland some 500 years earlier. So, hat's off to Leif.

But if you think about it, the whole concept of discovering America is, well, arrogant.

After all, the Native Americans discovered North America about 14,000 years before Columbus was even born! Surprisingly, DNA evidence now suggests that courageous [Polynesian adventurers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1965514/) sailed dugout canoes across the Pacific and settled in South America long before the Vikings.

Second, [Columbus wasn't a hero](http://www.nativeamericannetroots.net/diary/177/). When he set foot on that sandy beach in the Bahamas on October 12, 1492, Columbus discovered that the islands were inhabited by friendly, peaceful people called the Lucayans, Taínos and Arawaks. Writing in his diary, Columbus said they were a handsome, smart and kind people.

He noted that the gentle Arawaks were [remarkable for their hospitality](http://books.google.com/books?id=P8V7J5qm5-YC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).

&gt;""They offered to share with anyone and when you ask for something, they never say no,"" he said.

The [Arawaks had no weapons](http://socyberty.com/history/genocide-of-christopher-columbus/); their society had neither criminals, prisons nor prisoners. They were so kind-hearted that Columbus noted in his diary that on the day the Santa Maria was shipwrecked, the Arawaks labored for hours to save his crew and cargo.

The native people were so honest that not one thing was missing.

Columbus was so impressed with the hard work of these gentle islanders, that he immediately seized their land for Spain and enslaved them to work in his brutal gold mines. Within only two years, 125,000 (half of the population) of the original natives on the island were dead.

Shockingly, Columbus supervised the selling of native girls into [sexual slavery](http://www.danielnpaul.com/ChristopherColumbus.html). Young girls of the ages 9 to 10 were the most desired by his men. In 1500, Columbus casually wrote about it in his log.

He said:

&gt;""A hundred castellanoes are as easily obtained for a woman as for a farm, and it is very general and there are plenty of dealers who go about [looking for girls](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/History/Hero-making_LMTTM.html); those [from nine to ten are now in demand](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/History/Hero-making_LMTTM.html).""

He forced these peaceful natives work in his gold mines until they died of exhaustion.

If an ""Indian"" worker did not deliver his full quota of gold dust by Columbus' deadline, soldiers would [cut off the man's hands](http://www.criticalthink.info/Phil1301/lieshist.htm) and tie them around his neck to send a message. Slavery was so intolerable for these sweet, gentle island people that at one point, 100 of them committed [mass suicide](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Zinn/Columbus_PeoplesHx.html).

Catholic law forbade the enslavement of Christians, but Columbus solved this problem. He simply refused to baptize the native people of Hispaniola.

On his second trip to the New World, Columbus brought [cannons and attack dogs](http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/40/183.html). If a native resisted slavery, he would cut off a nose or an ear. If slaves tried to escape, Columbus had them burned alive. Other times, he sent attack dogs to hunt them down, and the [dogs would tear off the arms and legs](http://www.criticalthink.info/Phil1301/lieshist.htm) of the screaming natives while they were still alive.

If the Spaniards ran short of meat to feed the dogs, Arawak babies were [killed for dog food](http://www.unitednativeamerica.com/issues/statue.html).

Columbus' acts of cruelty were so unspeakable and so legendary - even in his own day - that Governor [**Francisco De Bobadilla** arrested Columbus ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus#Governorship_and_arrest)and his two brothers, slapped them into chains, and shipped them off to Spain to answer for their crimes against the Arawaks.

But the King and Queen of Spain, their treasury filling up with gold, pardoned Columbus and let him go free.

**Christopher** **Columbus' Crimes Against Humanity**

To be sure, the real annihilations did not start until the beginning of Columbus' second voyage to the Americas in 1493 (1).

For while he had expressed admiration for the overall generosity of Indigenous People and considered the Tainos to be ""Very handsome, gentle, and friendly,"" he interpreted all these positive traits as signs of weakness and vulnerability, saying,

&gt;""if devout religious persons knew the Indian Language well, all these people would soon become Christians.""

As a consequence, he kidnapped some of the Tainos and took them back to Spain.

&gt;On his second voyage, in December 1494, Columbus captured 1,500 Tainos on the island of Hispaniola and herded them to Isabela, where 550 of ""the best males and females"" were forced aboard ships bound for the slave markets of Seville.  
   
Under Columbus's leadership, the Spanish attacked the Taino, sparing neither men, women nor children. Warfare, forced labor, starvation and disease reduced Hispaniola's Taino population (estimated at one million to two million in 1492) to extinction within 30 years.

[Furthermore, Columbus wrote a letter to the Spanish governor of the island, Hispaniola](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0161-2492%28199221%2915%3A2%3C321%3AJF%3E2.0.CO%3B2-V&amp;size=LARGE&amp;origin=JSTOR-enlargePage), Columbus asked the governor the cut off the ears and the noses of any of the slaves who resisted being subjugated to slavery.

&gt;…It is estimated that 100 million Indians from the Caribbean, Central, South, and North America perished at the hands of the European invaders. Sadly, unbelievably, really, much of that wholesale destruction was sanctioned and carried out by the Roman Catholic Church and various Protestant denominations. (1: p.37)

One of Columbus' men, [**Bartolome De Las Casas**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas), was so mortified by Columbus' brutal atrocities against the native peoples, that he quit working for Columbus and became a Catholic priest.

He described how the Spaniards under Columbus' command cut off the legs of children who ran from them, to test the sharpness of their blades.

According to De Las Casas, [the men made bets](http://www.mit.edu/~thistle/v9/9.11/1columbus.html) as to who, with one sweep of his sword, could cut a person in half. He says that Columbus' men poured people full of boiling soap.

In a single day, De Las Casas was an eye witness as the Spanish soldiers dismembered, beheaded, or raped 3000 native people.

&gt;""Such inhumanities and barbarisms were committed in my sight as no age can parallel,"" De Las Casas wrote. ""My eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature that now [I tremble as I write](http://www.creators.com/liberal/norman-solomon.html).""

De Las Casas spent the rest of his life trying to protect the helpless native people.

But after a while, there were no more natives to protect. Experts generally agree that before 1492, the population on the island of Hispaniola probably numbered above [3 million](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno_people#Population_decline). Within 20 years of Spanish arrival, it was reduced to only 60,000.

Within 50 years, [not a single original native inhabitant could be found](http://www.glencoe.com/sec/socialstudies/btt/columbus/native_peoples.shtml).

Columbus Day Poem Taught to U.S. School Children

&amp;#x200B;

|| In fourteen hundred ninety-twoColumbus sailed the ocean blue. ||
|:-|:-|:-|
|| He had three ships and left from Spain;He sailed through sunshine, wind and rain.||
|| He sailed by night; he sailed by day;He used the stars to find his way. ||
|| A compass also helped him knowHow to find the way to go. ||
||Ninety sailors were on board; Some men worked while others snored.||
|| Then the workers went to sleep;And others watched the ocean deep.||
|| Day after day they looked for land;They dreamed of trees and rocks and sand. ||
|| October 12 their dream came true,You never saw a happier crew !||
|| ""Indians! Indians!"" Columbus cried;His heart was filled with joyful pride ||
|| But ""India"" the land was not;It was the Bahamas, and it was hot .||
|| The Arakawa natives were very nice;They gave the sailors food and spice.||
|| Columbus sailed on to find some goldTo bring back home, as he'd been told. ||
|| He made the trip again and again,Trading gold to bring to Spain. ||
|| The first American? No, not quite.But Columbus was brave, and he was bright. ||

### Conventional History

Columbus Day first became an official state holiday in Colorado in 1906, and became a [federal holiday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States) in the United States in 1937, though people have celebrated Columbus' voyage since the colonial period.

In 1792, New York City and other U.S. cities celebrated the 300th anniversary of his landing in the New World.

President [**Benjamin Harrison**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison) called upon the people of the United States to celebrate Columbus Day on the 400th anniversary of the event. During the four hundredth anniversary in 1892, teachers, preachers, poets and politicians used Columbus Day rituals to teach ideals of patriotism. These *patriotic* rituals were framed around themes such as support for war, citizenship boundaries, the importance of loyalty to the nation, and celebrating social progress.

[Catholic immigration in the mid-19th century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_the_United_States#19th_century) induced discrimination from anti-immigrant activists.

Like many other immigrant communities, Catholics developed organizations to fight discrimination and provide insurance for the struggling immigrants. One such organization, the [Knights of Columbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_Columbus), chose that name in part because it saw Christopher Columbus as a fitting symbol of Catholic immigrants' right to citizenship: one of their own, a fellow Catholic, had discovered America.

Many [Italian-Americans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian-Americans) observe Columbus Day as a celebration of their heritage, the first occasion being in New York City on October 12, 1866.

Columbus Day was first popularized as a holiday in the United States through the lobbying of Angelo Noce, a first generation Italian, in Denver. The first official, regular Columbus Day holiday was proclaimed by Colorado governor Jesse F. McDonald in 1905 and made a statutory holiday in 1907.

In April 1934, as a result of lobbying by the Knights of Columbus, Congress and President [Franklin Delano Roosevelt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt) made October 12 a [federal holiday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holiday) under the name Columbus Day.

&gt;A Significant movement is spreading to rename this day 'Indigenous People's Day'. It could/would begin the healing to right the wrongs done to so many by the Conquistador's of white European Man, of which most are of our ancestral heritages.**Petition** [**here**](http://www.petitiononline.com/indian/petition.html)

Indigenous Natives lived with the land, air and waterways for thousands and thousands of years and never thought to own or despoil their Mother's and Father's who gave Life to all.

 Today, we are losing 200 species a day, globally, many waterways in the U.S., like the Navarro River where I live, no longer have salmon and trout come up the river or like the halibut, snapper, rock fish, salmon, etc. that are fished out along the West Coast.

What a huge step it would be for this country if we could begin to ask forgiveness, make reparations and put these proud Natives in places of leadership to teach us how to be good stewards and hold deep reverence and respect for Nature so that she may heal and provide for the next seven generations to come.

RECONSIDER COLUMBUS DAY AD

Columbus Day, a day that our government has deemed worthy of remembrance.

But with all due respect - with all due respect - with all due respect, there's an ugly truth that has been overlooked for way too long. Columbus committed heinous crimes against the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean and millions of natives throughout the Americas.

And Columbus set the stage for the slave trade in the New World. So, please, please reconsider if this is a man you want to honor. Reconsider if you want to celebrate the crimes of Columbus. It's not your fault; it happened a long time ago.

But remaining neutral and pretending like it didn't happen, or that it doesn't still impact us today?

So, please, take the day to learn the whole story: [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il5hwpdJMcg)

For christsakes, the guy C.C. thought he was in INDIA or so the story goes!

He then found the indigenous people so giving, he went back to get 14 more galleon ships to steal, pillage, rape and conquer the peaceful people throughout the Caribbean, South and North America's. For an excellent overview of the plight of the 'loser's' to American hegemony over the centuries read Howard Zinn's [A People's History of The United States](http://www.amazon.com/A-Peoples-History-United-States/dp/0060838655/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8), as told by those that suffered at the hands of the invaders.)

As the nation commemorates the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the so-called ""New World"" in 1492, indigenous activists at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado, are pushing for schools to teach the ""real history of the Americas"" and to celebrate indigenous culture.

""Columbus Day"" has long evoked sadness and anger amongst people of color, especially Native Americans, who object to honoring a man who opened the door to European colonization, the exploitation of native peoples, and the slave trade.

&gt;""The official story that Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas is ludicrous.  
   
A few miles from Edinburgh in Scotland today still stands Rosslyn Chapel, that holy grail of the Brotherhood Elite. It was built in the shape of a Templar cross by the St Clair-Sinclair family and is a mass of esoteric symbolism.  
   
The foundations were laid in 1446 and it was completed in the 1480s. How remarkable then that the stonework at Rosslyn includes depictions of sweetcorn and cacti which were only found in America and Christopher Columbus did not 'discover' that continent until 1492! How could this be? There is, in fact, no mystery. Christopher Columbus was not even nearly the first white person to land in the Americas.  
   
The Phoenicians, Norse, Irish, Welsh, Bretons, Basques and Portuguese, all sailed to America before him and so did Prince Henry Sinclair of Rosslyn, as documented in a rare book by Frederick I. Pohl called Prince Henry Sinclair's Voyage To The New World 1398.  
   
Sinclair made the journey with another Brotherhood bloodline, the Zeno family, one of the most prominent [Black Nobility families](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_blacknobil.htm) in Venice. Sinclair and Antonio Zeno landed in what we call Newfoundland and went ashore in Nova Scotia (New Scotland) in 1398…  
   
The Brotherhood had known about the Americas for thousands of years and Christopher Columbus was used to make the official discovery so that the occupation of the Americas could begin.""  
**David Icke, ""The Biggest Secret"" 178-9**

Columbus' supporters were European royalty and [the Templars](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_masonsknightstemplar.htm).

His father-in-law was a former Templar Knight and Catherine de Medici of the Illuminati bloodline (along with others) financed his voyage. Columbus' three ships sailed under the Templars Red Cross flag, used today by the Red Cross and Switzerland.

The royals also sent out fleets of conquistadors and swash-buckling pirates flying [the Skull and Bones](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_skullbones.htm) flag - their orders to rape, kill, and pillage all they could from the New World.

&gt;""The Skull and Bones cross used by the secret society comes from the pirate skull and cross bones.

**A Little Matter of Genocide - Ward Churchill**

[**Source**](http://www.monabaker.com/pMachine/more.php?id=A2068_0_1_0_M)

During the four centuries spanning the time between 1492, when Christopher Columbus first set foot on the 'New World' of a Caribbean beach and 1892, when the US Census Bureau concluded that there were fewer than a quarter-million indigenous people surviving within the country's boundaries, *a hemispheric population estimated to have been as great as 125 million was reduced by something over 90 percent*.

The people had died in their millions of being hacked apart with axes and swords, buried alive and trampled under horses, hunted as game and fed to dogs, shot, beaten, stabbed, scalped for bounty, hanged on meat-hooks and thrown over the sides of ships at sea, worked to death as slave laborers, intentionally starved and frozen to death during a multitude of forced marches and internments, and, in an unknown number of instances, deliberately infected with epidemic diseases. (p. 1)

Later in the book he gives a staggering estimate of the total who were 'ethnically cleansed':

&gt;'All told, it is probable that more than one hundred million native people were 'eliminated' in the course of Europe's ongoing 'civilization' of the western hemisphere.' (p. 86)

Although Ward Churchill has not written fully on the genocide against the Palestinians, he does place it within the global context of the present book, A Little Matter of Genocide, a book which leapt out at me from a display of books by and about native Americans in City Lights Book Store.

The author is an enrolled Keetoowah Cherokee and Professor of American Indian Studies in the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder and has been a leader of the Colorado Chapter of the American Indian Movement since 1972.

The title of the book is taken from a statement by **Russell Means**, founder of the American Indian Movement, who spoke of 'a little matter of genocide right here at home,' by which he meant the ongoing genocide against the American Indians which is still in progress.

**A Little Matter of Genocide**

The U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Comes Clean 185 years later

[**Source**](http://www.russellmeansfreedom.com/2009/bia-head-admits-to-american-indian-genocide/)

&gt;""Immediately upon its establishment in 1824, the Office of Indian Affairs was an instrument by which the United States enforced its ambition against the Indian nations. As the nation expanded West, the agency participated in the ethnic cleansing that befell the western tribes.  
   
War begets tragedy, but the deliberate spread of disease, the decimation of the bison herds, the use of alcohol to destroy mind and body, and the cowardly killing of women and children made for tragedy on a scale so ghastly that it cannot be dismissed as merely the inevitable consequence of the clash of competing ways of life.  
   
After the devastation of tribal economies, the BIA set out to destroy all things Indian by forbidding the speaking of Indian languages, prohibiting traditional religious activities, outlawing traditional government, and making Indians ashamed of who they were.  
   
Worst of all, the BIA committed these acts against the children entrusted to its boarding schools.  
   
The trauma of shame, fear, and anger has passed from one generation to the next, and manifests itself in the rampant alcoholism, drug abuse, and domestic violence that plague Indian country.  
   
The BIA expresses its profound sorrow for these wrongs, extends this formal apology to Indian people for its historical conduct, and makes promises for its future conduct.""

**The Canary Effect**

*The Canary Effect* is a 2006 documentary that looks into the effects of that the United States and its policies have on the Indigenous peoples (Native Americans) who are residents.

It premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and won the Stanley Kubrick Award at the 2006 Traverse City Film Festival (Michael Moore hosts).

The movie was directed by **Robin Davey** and **Yellow Thunder Woman**, who are both members of LA Based alternative pop group *The Bastard Fairies*.

Delving deeply into the often misunderstood and frequently over looked historic realities of the American Indian, *The Canary Effect* follows the terrifying and horrific abuses instilled upon the Indigenous people of North America, and details the genocidal practices of the US government and its continuing affects on present day Indian country.

Featuring interviews with the leading scholars and experts on Indian issues including controversial author Ward Churchill, the film brings together the past and present in a way never before captured so eloquently and boldly on film.

**DENNIS BANKS:** I was in the boarding schools when punishment was very severe if you ran away.

This was during the early '40s. I was taken to a boarding school when I was four years old, and taken away from my mother and my father, my grandparents, who I stayed with most of the time, and just abruptly taken away and then put into the boarding school, 300 miles away from our home.

And, you know, the beatings began immediately, the - almost the de-Indianizing program. It was a terrible experience that the American government was experimenting with. And that was trying to destroy the culture and the person, destroy the Indian-ness in him and save the human being, save the - kill an Indian, save the man.

That was, you know, the description of what this policy is about, about trying to -

**AMY GOODMAN:** Now, the government ran the schools?

**DENNIS BANKS:** The U.S. government paid - of course, they ran a lot of the schools themselves, but they also delegated a lot of it to the Christians, Christian communities.

The Catholics had some. The Episcopalians had some. The Lutherans had some. Methodists had some. And so, it was like a complicit - there was complicity between the churches and the state in taking care of Indian problem, solving the Indian problem, and trying to change who we were.

**AMY GOODMAN:** Dennis, where had - where had you lived? Where had you lived, and where were you brought to school?

**DENNIS BANKS:** I lived on the federal - or, on the Leech Lake Indian Reservation, where I was born, in northern Minnesota. And I was taken to a boarding school 300 miles away to the south, southernmost part of Minnesota, the southwestern part, called Pipestone Indian School. I stayed there three years - six years -

**AMY GOODMAN:** And how -

**DENNIS BANKS:** Go ahead.

**AMY GOODMAN:** How did you communicate with your family? And how often did you get to see them? Did you get to talk to them?

**DENNIS BANKS:** Never. Never.

You know, they cut off all communication with your parents, and a lot of letters, which I found later in - I stayed there for six years without communicating to - with my parents at all. And finally, they let us go home for six years. Of course, we couldn't speak the language. We could speak only English and - what these young people were talking about.

But there was severe punishment for running away from that kind of system. I ran away. I kept running away. Almost once a week, I'd run away from those schools. They'd catch me. They'd bring me back to the school, beat me. And it was - it was terrible.

I mean, there was other kinds of punishment that we went through, as well. And it was - now that, it was a - that kind of experience, I still remember what it is like today. And I have a friend who has been - who had been my friend for over 70 years now, and we remember those days.

There were - we stuck together. A lot of people stuck together. Just being together, that's what saved a lot of us from terrible consequences of speaking. But eventually, they - you know, they kept beating me down, and I kept - so I started learning English, and I started learning who the presidents were. I started learning all that stuff.

And then they let me go home for 30 days. Six years. And I asked my mother, I said, ""Why didn't you write to me?"" And she - you know, and she says, ""I did."" But I never - I never questioned beyond that. And then there was - they sent me to another boarding school in North Dakota, another 200 miles away. I was there for three years.

And then, after that, same thing: no - only English, you know, corporal punishment. And then I went home for another 30 days, asked my mother, ""Why is it you didn't write to me again?"" She says, ""I did, and I did.""

Then they sent me to another boarding school in South Dakota further away, so another 400 miles. I kept running away from these schools. And I finally ran away from the last one, and I finally made it home.

And it wasn't 'til almost just three years ago when my daughter was - they were doing a documentary on Dennis Banks, and they found - they went to - in the federal depository records in Kansas City.

And she called me, and she says, ""Dad, we found"" - ""Dad,"" she said, ""we found your - we found your school records."" And I said, ""Bring them back."" So she brought them back, and I started looking at them. And she says, ""Dad, we also found something else.""

She handed me a shoebox. And I opened up the shoebox, and those were letters, letters from my mother. And I started opening them up, and I started reading them.

And in the second one, there was a letter to the superintendent of the school that said,

&gt;""Here is $5. Please send my children - my son back home to me.""

Post your best conspiracy theories. Here’s mine:

In 2015 there was a test done at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. It was headed by Ralph Baric.

https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/lab-made-coronavirus-triggers-debate-34502

The purpose of the lab test was to manipulate a bat coronavirus to see if it could infect humans. It was discovered that it could.

https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985

One of the people who co wrote the paper was a Chinese researcher by the name of Xing-Ye Gi. Google scholar shows Gi has written or co-written numerous papers on SARS, ebola and coronavirus.

https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=%22Xing-Yi+Ge%22&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_allsubj=all&amp;hl=en

Gi works in Wuhan, within the sole BSL-4 lab in the entire country. A Chinese national literally worked on modifying a bat coronavirus to infect humans, 100% confirmed. Hmm...

There are only 70 BSL-4 (Highest Level Biosafety research labs) in the world, and in China, a country of 1.4 Billion people, only 1 exists. Coincidentally, it happens to be in Wuhan. The people in Wuhan aren’t the only Chinese eating stuff like bat soup, this would have to be a pretty crazy coincidence since there are at least 9 cities larger than Wuhan and it could have appeared in any one of them, but it just happened to appear next to the sole bioweapon lab in the entire country.

https://www.nature.com/news/inside-the-chinese-lab-poised-to-study-world-s-most-dangerous-pathogens-1.21487

This article was written in 2017 about its construction, and was worried about the potential safety since this is China’s first attempt at such a lab, and it wasn’t receiving guidance from the rest of the world on its construction. The article also mentions one of the first viruses it will be working on is SARS. The Coronavirus is closely related to SARs from initial inspection. The article warned that this lab would likely be dual use, as China claims it only exists to help research and cure disease when in reality China also wants to get in the Bioweapon game with the other superpowers.

A Bioweapon escaping such a lab isn’t impossible, as Anthrax escaped a Soviet bioweapon lab in 1979 killing at least 100 people, but the true number is unknown as they denied it happened at all for more than a decade. Soviets lied saying it was due to tainted meat, and the KGB destroyed all hospital records and other evidence. They were extremely lucky with which way the wind was blowing, as if it blew the other way spores would have landed in a nearby city killing hundreds of thousands of people. Boris Yeltsin eventually admitted to the truth of this Biological Chernobyl.

SARS even escaped a Beijing lab twice!

Laboratory safety at the Chinese Institute of Virology under close scrutiny
Apr 26, 2004
The latest outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China, with eight confirmed or suspected cases so far and hundreds quarantined, involves two researchers who were working with the virus in a Beijing research lab, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday (April 26).
“We suspect two people, a 26-year-old female postgraduate student and a 31-year-old male postdoc, were both infected, apparently in two separate incidents,” Bob Dietz, WHO spokesman in Beijing, told The Scientist.
The woman was admitted to hospital on April 4, but the man apparently became infected independently 2 weeks later, being hospitalized on April 17. Both worked at the Chinese Institute of Virology in Beijing, part of China's Center for Disease Control.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2004/07/sars-crisis-topples-china-lab-chief

Now to speculate. I don’t think it is a completed bioweapon as China would likely have a vaccine ready for it to protect their people after deployment against an enemy, and it would likely be far more dangerous. Much more likely is that is an only partially complete bioweapon, a chimera SARS with aspects of other viruses thrown in as they experiment with creating the final product. This is what leaked. Since it is only an early prototype, there is no vaccine ready yet, and it will still be far more dangerous than a natural virus. This is also a huge reason for the coverup. If it gets out that China let a bioweapon escape, there will be an international shitshow. Unlike what other conspiracy theorists have speculated, I find it extremely doubtful that a bioweapon was released deliberately, as there is no believeable motive and this will inflict terrible damage on China economically.

This may not be just a tragic accident.

*For ex-pot kingpin, new trouble—health supplements*

“Jared Wheat has been on the government’s radar for more than two decades. Twenty years ago, he was convicted as a drug smuggler who operated a massive marijuana ring in the South. Now, Wheat must pay a $40 million judgment and recall health supplements that a judge says falsely claim to burn fat and cure erectile dysfunction.”

“Amazingly while he’s in jail, he decides he needs to make more money, sell more product,” Jim Kohm, associate director of the Enforcement Division at the FTC, told CNBC. ”He was calling the shots for the whole thing and he was doing so in jail.”

“In a plea bargain, the defendants admitted to operating a manufacturing facility in Belize that made generic versions of such pharmaceuticals as Xanax, Valium, Ambien, Vioxx, Zoloft, Viagra and Cialis and selling them over the Internet without requiring prescriptions.”

“The plea bargain recommended that Wheat receive a prison sentence of 37 months, but Judge Camp rejected that at a sentencing hearing last month, saying it was not severe enough for “the seriousness of the conduct.""

“The judge previously sentenced Hi-Tech officials Stephen D. Smith and Tomasz Holda to serve 27 months and 16 1/2 months, respectively. Holda’s sentence will be served consecutively with time he is now serving for a federal firearms offense.”

“Under a plea deal, three other defendants were sentenced to jail terms of 16 to 27 months; the judge found the 37 months for Wheat suggested in the plea was not harsh enough for his actions. During plea negotiations, prosecutors dropped allegations of racketeering, spiking supplements with ephedrine alkaloids and conspiracies of blackmail and murder.”

*Hi-Tech official Tomasz Holda’s wife commits suicide?*

“Holda took a .40-caliber Ruger pistol and shot herself in the head. The lawsuit contends she killed herself after Danzig threatened to prosecute her for selling a luxury car that the government had targeted for seizure if she didn’t assist in the federal investigation.”

However I'm wondering if the arguments for gay marriage can be used to support other questionable romantic/sexual relationships such as incest or bestiality.  Take the phrase, ""love is love.""  That means anybody should be able to love whomever they want.  Is the government allowed to tell us who or who not to have sexual relations with?  For example, many years ago, we had the same reaction to gay marriage as we did to ""unusual relationships"" like mentioned before.  On a legal standpoint, I understand why bestiality and pedophilia are illegal, as one of the parties are unable to give consent.  But what about incest?  In this situation, both parties are able to give consent.  From what I understand, incest results to higher rates of genetic diseases and disabilities in children - especially brother/sister relationships - which is the only reason I can think of why it is illegal.  What if the factor of procreating are out of the equation - both parties are in a situation where neither want or in risk of having children, eliminating inbred children?  In this case the only argument against incest is that it's morally wrong in the eyes of the general public.  Do you think such relationships could be legalized in the future?  Consider that only decades ago, the general consensus was that gay marriage was morally wrong.

Chapter 17: Project MKUltra

January 28, 2020

In 2018 I completed my video work and I have not returned to video since. This does not mean that I will not create video projects for myself in the future, but what it does mean is that the mission for my video project was completed. With ""This Book Is a Game"" now complete, my writing work is coming to its finalisation. This does not mean that after this book that I will not write in my future. But what it does mean is that my mission for my writing project is coming to its completion. From 2018 to 2019 I finalised everything that I needed to say in video. And now I am finalising everything that I need to say in writing. I likely will do video and writing in my future. But it will serve a different purpose. Like stated in the last chapter, I am not required to perform the same monotonous task again and again like the brainwashed populace of our world. Once I have completed the work, it is done and I never have to do it again. I have so much work available that people can spend years watching and reading it and likely still have more of it to experience. It would take a really hardcore fan to complete my work. So what is the point of making more of it, especially when I have stated all of the fundamentals of what I am presenting? There is no point. The point is that my work is coming to its completion. And it will work for me for the rest of my life with little to no effort. I was smart. Actually, God was smart.

After my ex-wife left me, I was extremely depressed. I almost killed myself but right before the action, I literally passed out on the floor. This is when God literally revealed Himself to me. I spoke with God about my life and God revealed to me the next ten years of it. But what a task God assigned me! How was I, as one person, to accomplish all that God had set out for me? I asked God if I had a choice. God told me that I could end my life at this moment, for my choice was to follow the vision God had given me or commit suicide. I asked if those were my only options. They were. So I was to choose ten years of hardship or suicide. I chose the ten years of hardship not because that was what I wanted but because as a child I gave my life to God. Since it is God's life and not mine, I chose to endure the next ten years. For if I murdered myself, I would be destroying God's property. I could not bring myself to destroy God's property. So I lived to see another day and recommitted my life to God. However, I was not happy about this arrangement because I knew what was to come.

And now, ten years later, I am free. I am an independent game developer and I am not required to obtain and maintain a typical job. I spend a lot of my time playing digital games and this is now considered my work because the more games I play, the more ideas I can integrate into my own game. I am not speaking of ripping other games off, as you will see in my game Ivory Heart. This game is incredibly unique. However, other games do assist in the creation of my own game. I can utilise techniques from other games to integrate into my game.

I have a method for recording one's thoughts that was passed on to me from a high. Just start writing your heart out about all the things you care about in life. You can write with a phone or a camera. Both are effective mediums to collect and convey information. Mix it up and use writing to assist your video work. You are not locked in a box.

And what are you to record? The answer is your heart. Imprint something on to this world in which you will be proud of. Use the educational ladder to convey your messages. But a heart is extremely complex and there are many sides to it. Yes, this is true which is why it is extremely important that you document it. Because you are extremely unique and you and your achievements deserve to be documented and showcased.

The development of Ivory Heart the video game is going very well. I can envision the game in my head. In addition, I have already created beautiful 3D environments to explore. Soon I will be working on quests. But this type of video game is not at all easy to create because it will have no violence in it. A game like this has never before been created. That is the advantage of being a philosopher. What you produce is incredibly unique and you will have no competitors. For this is not just a game to collect book chapters. The chapters are complimentary materials for the quests in the game. The quests are not linked to the information in the books. The chapters are the rewards for successfully completing quests. The chapters will in no way hold the game hostage. Because the learning will occur when interacting with the characters and performing their assigned duties.

Ivory Heart is a game created to inspire young girls to live a life of virtue quite literally saving the world. The heroine is the saviour of the game world. But her quests do not end in-game. The quests will be designed to teach the player what actions they need to make in real life in order to make a difference in this world. Ivory Heart is a finishing school for young girls. It teaches the ways of wisdom through an electronic classroom environment. It provides the player with a great deal of study materials that they can bring with them wherever they go. That is why it is important that I release my game on the Nintendo Switch. My game is being created with portability in mind. My game will provide all of the study materials required to successfully complete all its courses. My game is the future of the classroom. Physical buildings where school shooters love to play are so old school. I am literally converting the physical buildings into a digital atmosphere. My game will stand as a solid attempt to reinvent the ways in which we educate our young.

What teachers do you want to teach your children? Children deserve the best teachers possible but unfortunately our world is filled with terrible teachers. The best teachers will create new and innovative methods to teach their content. Eventually, this will put most teachers out of a job. This is a good thing and not a bad thing as we remove all the terrible teachers from the world and replace them with innovative creators. The world of our future education implementation is digital and it is now time to purge all who are analogue. The teachers of face to face are now obsolete. For we now have digital warriors who educate much more efficiently and effectively than the physical classroom environment. Who will you choose to educate your child? A gunman? A teacher that is so bad at their job that they couldn't even escape the nine to five? The teachers of the future are those who educate worldwide and not those who focus on their physical environment. How effective is a teacher that can only reach twenty kids? My reach is infinite and repeatable. For I live in the clouds. I only have to teach a lesson once and it is publicly available for all who are interested to learn from. 

The truth is that the education system is exploiting your kids. Yes, they babysit for you, but that is about how far their helpfulness goes. They know about online education and they know that they could reach the entire world if they wanted to. But they want your money and a scope like that is not profitable. That means that they value money above the well-being of your children. I truly care about your children and I could care less about your money. Who is the better teacher? Why would you allow this to go on? The answers are right in front of you. Our modern day education system is a mechanic in society utilised to brainwash the population. The point of school is to get your child into a nine to five. Does damning your child to the nine to five life sound like a loving thing to do? Of course it isn't. But here is the truth: most parents do not truly love their children. Just as the school exploits children, so do their parents. As children grow, parents begin to wonder what they can get out of their children. Most children of this world are slaves to their parents. And it is even common ""wisdom"" that parents should not be friends with their children. How ridiculous is that? If a parent of mine doesn't want to be my friend then I don't want to be their child.

We live in an age where that is very possible. If you have terrible parents, renounce them. If they do not have your best interest in mind, then flee from them. I was emancipated from my parents at the age of fifteen. They were taking actions against me that hurt me on a regular basis. Do not put up with that regardless if they are your parents or not. You deserve respect and if your parents are not going to give it to you, then don't give it to them. Just because they are your parents doesn't mean that they are family. In this day and age we choose our family. Who is my family? Those who do the works of God are my family. Does my family do the works of God? No, they do their own works. It is easy to see who does the works of God by analysing their works and its attachment to God. If their works are not associated with God, then they are not doing the works of God. See in what name they proclaim their works. For it is that name that is written to their hearts. And that name is usually money.

They were at it for more than a decade, but now they are sprinting to prepare the terrain for that checkpoint.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0NI0RDT8zM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0NI0RDT8zM) The Fed's Swan Song: The Mother of All Financial Disasters

CIA-controlled responses show desperate efforts to control the fall so that they can control the damage and starting positions of players after »reboot«.

BTW, YT channels like ADVChina etc are talking about  Xi’s talk about the market reboot and new beginning that is coming. But they fail to interpret that in the global scope – Xi/CCP seems to be saying that »reboot« is coming globally.  

It looks like »Mountain of Mordor/Germany« UfD is waiting for CDE to go down with inept Frau Merkel after the crash, when things are about to get extreme. This point will be used for the rise of new, »Fourth Reich«, this time with most of the »bugs« and snags of the previous versions avoided, removed or worked around.

It’s not clear if that is original intent of GWO or just compromise that they are expected to accept along the way. Formally, this is to be known as new EU with its armed forces, space program (WeltraumWaffe?) etc. Or perhaps they count on this new EU only as a temporary step ( just so it isn’t too obvious) after which FR,IT, etc are expected to leave and leave Germany with (national) socialism of some sort, bunch of vasal states on the south and east of the Europe up to Bulgaria etc.

856,Throwaway03220,ev408i,"Is it just me or is news about the US Air Force Air Combat Command plane crashing / possibly being shot down by members of the Taliban in Afghanistan's [eastern Ghazni province](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPSH8KqX4AEUXoL?format=jpg&amp;name=small) being suppressed by most major US news media outlets?

From what I've been able to find via Twitter searches on the topic it was initially reported by media yesterday that the plane was not one of ours, but instead was a passenger jet belonging to Iranian Ariana Airlines. The airline quickly denied this claim stating all their flights were safe and accounted for.

Shortly thereafter a spokesman for the Taliban, a man by the name of Zabihullah Mujahid, posted on his Twitter *(honestly didn’t know terrorists used Twitter spokespersons until today)* that insurgents with the group had shot down the plane and that it had confirmed deceased CIA officials on board. 

Following Mujahid's announcement, U.S. officials reported to [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/27/799967351/u-s-plane-goes-down-in-afghanistan-prompting-wave-of-questions-contradictions) that the plane was a U.S. Bombardier E-11A, and that it had “two people on board, both of whom died in the crash” after the plane went down due to what they’re calling “mechanical problems.”

In culmination of all of this, Russian media, citing Russian intel, [is now saying](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/top-cia-chief-behind-soleimani-21375358) that the plane shot down yesterday was carrying CIA Chief Michael D’Andrea, the head of CIA operations against Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq, who is said to have helped plan America's drone strike on Iranian General Qassem Soleimani earlier this month. This revelation is allegedly being reported on Iranian state TV.

You can verify for yourself via the photos I’ve linked below that the USAF plane seen in the videos of the wreckage is more than likely the same plane in the pictures.

**Photographs of the plane and wreckage:**

- [Twitter Video 2 at USAF Plane Wreckage Site](https://mobile.twitter.com/usmilitaryupd8/status/1221789729861009414)

To my untrained eyes, the fuselage of the plane appears to have suffered more than just “mechanical problems,” although that term itself is rather vague and nondescript. That being said, all pilots are trained to land planes even when there are mechanical issues with their aircraft.

**These pertinent questions remain to be answered:**

1. Why wasn’t there breaking news about this on the major news networks yesterday?

2. Why would you fly that large of an aircraft over Taliban controlled area, especially with only two people on board?

3. Is Michael D’Andrea confirmed deceased?",conspiracy,Major US News Media organizations not reporting on the USAF Air Combat Command plane that crashed in Afghanistan yesterday

So in 2nd Enoch's book from old testamet you can read that ""God""(God could mean more advanced civilisation looking like us IMO) shown him Sun cycles,Moon cycles,Sun and Moon names and what is very curious is 364 days year cycle in Chapter 1 Verse 16.

We calculated that year is \~ 365.242189 days long.

Maya civilisation for example were able to calculate it being 365 days too.

Was ""God"" not right and teached Enoch wrong?

What do you think about possibility of every next year cycle being longer than previous one?Maybe Vatican and THEY made us believe year is 365,24 days long and we don't even question it anymore because we are ""sure"" year is 365 days long so whou would waste time and do research to find out year is truly 365 days long?

I think there is also a posibility of every Earth cycle being slightly longer than previous one.I'm no astronomist or ""scientist"" but this is how I would see it.

Enoch was 7th generation after Adam.We don't know exactly when Adam was created,5000 years ago,10 000,20 000,50 000?We don't know it.

[Maya civilization existed](https://www.ancient.eu/Maya_Civilization/) \~7000-2000 BC only God knows when they were able to calculate 365 days cycle.They could be able to do it 5000BC or 3000BC,we don't know it for sure.

If we assume Enoch lived before Maya civilization and at his time year was 364 days long then Maya civilization was created few thousand years after him and for them year now has 365 days.Few thousand years pass and now we calculate year is 365,24 days long.How do we explain it then?It looks like every next earth cycle becomes longer,is Earth moving slightly further away from sun every year?

Often the discussion on this forum revolves around the elite class, and how they differ from the masses.  

There is only one difference.  The elites on this planet have been privy to the true nature of consciousness, and human existence.  The true human history.  They wield this knowledge as a weapon against the ""unwashed masses"".

How does it make you feel to know that privileged humans on this planet have access to universal truths that govern our existence, but refuse to share that knowledge with all humanity?  Truths which could set you free from your own existential crises, and allow you to live a life free from the burdens of oppression and slavery.  Technologies which could heal your illnesses, and rekindle your spirit, imagination, and drive to find purpose in you're own life.  

They think you aren't smart enough, important enough, or powerful enough to know the true meaning of existence.  They think they are acting in you're best interest.  They think you need to be herded, coerced, and lied to in order to create ""a system which works for everyone"" all while hiding the true nature of human life from those who need to understand it the most.  They honestly believe that it is necessary for you to be repressed and lied to, for you're own well being.       

They allow suffering on a global scale, just to keep the status quo, and keep things controllable.  They don't think you are capable of self determination.  They think you need to be managed as if you are livestock.  They think you will not be able to fully comprehend the nature of our existence, even though our creator embedded in each and every one of us, the desire to know the truth, and understand the significance of the smallest action and feelings.  They have convinced themselves, that there needs to be an elite class of humans ruling all others.  They will lie, murder, and erase history to keep this status quo.

Consequently, China might become the leader in a new kind of technology, that every nation will face in the future, and have an undeniable excuse for customers to buy their 5G and robotics technology.

This is worse than you think! 



The governments and tv reports are hiding the truth about the virus and how fast it spreads and how strong it is.

We all see in the Televisions, articles and in websites about the latest happenings in China. But that is not exactly true. 


People inside Wuhan and other provinces are suffering from the effects of the virus. 

People from Wuhan tells their experience in the social media, some of the videos are shutdown by the authority, and posts are being tracked by them.

A busy road with so much people becomes ghost town in just days.

Hospitals and doctors are also suffering from the effects of the virus.

They lack power and equipments to function well and their strengths are also deteriorating.

In fact doctors are also dying because of the virus, they sacrificed themselves for the people, to cure them. 

They work endlessly to prevent the virus and the spreading of this. 

Some of them are treated poorly by patients and other doctors and nurses are being spit by other patients, wanting to them die also.

Patients were suffering due to the lack of doctors and nurses and also spaces in the Hospitals.

These situations are not being announced and declared by the government though they reported that they will build 10 Hospitals in 10 days for the Victims of the Virus.

It's a good news for the people.

Other nurses and doctors reported that they were also lacking of disposable suits and masks.


If the reports of these people are true then this Country will die because of their Pride.

I believed that other countries are willing to help them if they will allow them


So far there are some reports that some people recovered completely from the virus, but we dont know how true is it.

They dont want to cause widespread panic across the world, so Chinese government and Western governments are keeping information regarding the virus and potential pandemic very quiet. This is worrying seeing as the infection rate is rapidly increasing, started in the highest populated country in the world, the strict quarantine and hazmat suits/ check points should be a very big scary awakening. Parts of China are very much looking apocalyptic, very similar to something you would seen in a zombie Hollywood film.

Wuhan is a very large city with a population over 11 million, the entire city is under quarantine lockdown. Very serious action to take for a virus the media is saying not to worry about. With a population of 11 million and a virus symptom free period is a deadly combination. How many people have the virus without realising, and can also still spread the virus without knowing.

Wuhan is also home to a biological studying facility, recently testing Flu virus. Very interesting how this has emerged 2miles down the road to 'bio-weapon factory'

At this point of this post, 106 people dead. This statistic is MUCH higher, most likely in the thousands, loads of video footage leaked online from Chinese citizens displaying overcrowded hospitals, dead people in the street, families screaming and torn apart due to infected being taken and quarantined and instant cremation. 

The global elite (SATANIC CABAAL) have been planning a mass de-population static for many years. The rise of AI is in perfect timing for the replacement of mankind as we no longer are of use to the elite in power. A virus they have manufactured which only the rich and powerful/chosen are given the antidote/vaccine.

The virus has began from some sort of animal, evidence is pointing towards a snake. Virus that start from animals are incredibility difficult to battle, due to the body having no natural defence and can very easily and quickly become deadly. 

A very well timed Netflix series regarding global flu pandemic which realised bang on time with the spread of the infection. Perfect example of predictive programming.

I recommend to just be precautions to stock up on food/tinned goods, medication and water(atleast a 2 week supply). If this was to become a pandemic, medical supplies and produce will become very limited especially to smaller towns/cities. Bigger cities with higher population will recieve the priority of goods and medicine. Hospitals will be overwhelmed with medical admissions. Buy a battery powered radio system, to keep in the loop if all media has a black out.  Also keep a small amount of cash as back up, as if S\*\*\* hits the fan, banks, ATMs and pretty much anything will be closed.

889,Jam102,ev2o5p,"Just a thought that occurred to me.

There's lots of information and theories about why we have so many systems in place along with many theories; population control, mind alteration, dominance etc etc.

However, what if all these theories are inherently wrong, and we've been looking at it the wrong way altogether.

Instead of a secret kabal of shadowy figures, systematically controlling everything like a chess game - what if we have innately created a system of control over the period of human nature, that allows us to control and limit our natural predatory and animalistic nature.

The thought first occurred to me when I watched a film based off a real social experiment. Most of you probably know about it:

Around 25 people were taken to a prison like building. Half became guards, half prisoners. With no interference from a controlling body, the guards quite quickly devolved into tormenting, abusing, dehumanising and eventually killing one of the prisoners. (really good film, Adrian Brody, Forrest Whittaker, check it out).

It led me to question how inherently good we actually are. You see the ""systems"" we have in place are constantly reminding us of moral goodness. The act of charity, of kindness. Would we need to be reminded so much so, if we were already inherently good.

OR

Are the systems we so often deride as controlling and oppressive, the very reason we're able to live in a functioning society, albeit with many problems, but still functioning.

It's quite sad but it seems like something horrible about a patient being mistreated and dying because of this is in the news frequently. I myself have spent lots of times in hospitals this last year and let me tell you first hand, it does not matter if you are old or young these hospitals and their workers will let you die before they give a shit about treating you.

Go in with a life-threatening emergency and literally have to wait 24 hours to get a proper hospital room (IF YOU'RE LUCKY) most times they will just turn you away. Being paraded with questions from dozens of different personnel, do these co-workers not communicate with one another, do they lack elementary communication skills?

Hard to believe right? Well there's a lot of ""who cares, not my problem"" attitude from A LOT of the personnel working at hospitals, it's fucking pathetic. Most treat it like any other job just trying to get a paycheck, and most young doctors are completely incompetent and seem to lack an ounce of common sense or education.

What kind of education are these new hires receiving before being thrown into the workplace literally not knowing anything. Is this more of an education problem, money allocation problem, or just how the healthcare system has seemed to shape up?

In all those months spent around hospitals.. out of the approximately 50 employees I had personally come in contact with I can safely say that about 3 of them seemed to know what they were doing, competent, caring, compassionate, and trying to make a difference (all older with what seemed like a lot of knowledge and experience in the profession).

* if space permits, it can have IR flash (LED)
* it can have NFC communication side\_channel as main, only or additional channel
* usually that secondary channel is NFC. It can be  triggered by a coded pulse and its signal is meant to be received with Software Defined Radio or similar device.

This is a bit of a word dump, and I'm on mobile so excuse my shit formatting, I just want to touch base with this community on this one.

I'm going to preface this by stating that I assume everyone reading this knows the current situation with the Hong Kong, and *many* other countries around the planets protests, Epstein ""dying"", and the state of unrest involving society these days.

Also, on a personal note. I have an 8 year old child that just came back from Vietnam two and a half weeks ago. And she has a virus that started kicking in about half a week ago. The docs are saying it's just a normal respiratory infection. 

Anyway. To the meat of this. 

I'm throwing around the idea that this pandemic is a diversion, but possibly a culling tactic as well. 

If people start catching this en masse? That is a huge red flag, and I'm getting the feeling that we are being predisposed to be okay with it.

Cities being quarantined is fucking insane in the first place, but if we start seeing it outside of China.. I'm pretty sure you all know what that is the prefix to.

On top of this, I'm thinking about the mass protests around the world regarding civil rights. 

We were (in my opinion) getting pretty close to the whole unified ""eat the rich"" moment that everyone that is paying attention has been waiting for. 

Now everyone who is following this (possibly man made pandemic) is looking out for themselves and their borders. 

In my opinion, this is classic divisiveness, on a global scale.

 I'm not sure if what I'm trying to articulate is what's going on, but I'd like to hear anyone's thoughts about this idea who has read this far. 

Also! If anyone reading this is in a country that is currently having any kind of protests, I would love to hear anything from the ground.

I still frequent mainstream media outlets like the [New York Times ](https://www.nytimes.com/) and [Reuters](https://mobile.reuters.com/) but I take everything that I read there with a grain of salt. News headlines and articles are often *framed* in a way by mainstream media in order to influence more than to inform and headlines  often tend toward biases and often the meat of the articles under biased headlines don’t correlate with what the headlines state or infer. 

An often used trick is to align pictures alongside headlines and articles which are meant to portray through pictures the bias or intent the outlet wants to infer—you’ll see a headline or article about *Y candidate* which may be unfavorable to said candidate and alongside will be a picture of *Y candidate* looking down sadly or with a frown or fraught look on their face. “The Walls Are Closing In On Trump” with a picture of Trump—one of hundreds snapped by paparazzi and media photographers within mere seconds—seemingly looking fraught or scared.

981,BWet00,euzxft,"I have spent far too much time researching Kobe's death. Held off on theorizing until now and am going to keep it short - as there are a lot of other details I found surrounding his death that are ominous and suggest foul play (Island Express in particular). I am convinced Kobe Bryant was a blood sacrifice. The parallels between his death and Whitney Houston was the capper for me. 

Timing of Kobe's death:

* Less than 24h after LeBron passes him on all-time scoring
* Right before the Grammys - oddly enough held at Staples Center
* Grammys were a public mega-ritual hidden in plain sight. A bunch of Satanists and Luciferianists performing with hellfire in the background while holding his jersey.
* ""Passing of the torch"" to LeBron

Whitney Houston:

* A major icon in music industry. Found dead at Beverly Hills in LA.  
* At exact same location, few floors below, a pre-Grammy award party was taking place w 800+ guests. 
* The following day, the 2012 Grammys took place and was tainted with her death. 
* It was nothing short of another public mega ritual. 
* Creepy, satanic, symbolism galore with Whitney's ""replacement"", Jennifer Hudson, \*literally\* placed in the spotlight.   Passing of the torch. 

Mega, multicultural icons ""passing the torch"", whose deaths cause shockwaves around the world. MKUltra and Spirit Cooking freaks in the cesspool that is Hollywood/entertainment feasting on the powerful energy, performing mega-rituals with literal hellfire in the background.

 Firstly the virus ""escaped"" a level 4 containment facility. I find that the most suspect. A level 4 facility is engineered to have several redundancy systems in place. The people working there are not stupid they are not going to accidently release something like this and the systems in place would have stopped it somewhere.

Secondly the timing is suspect, the virus starts spreading right before the largest annual mass migration of people. And the quarantine didn't take effect untill after everyone already left for their new years 


This is probably an engineered virus, probably not a leaked ""weapon"" otherwise the boarders would have been closed a long time ago and flights would have been restricted. The reason I suspect this I because the USA said they have something but they won't be deploying it yet. Why would they say this I think it's they have tools to deal with this engineered strain but they don't want to show their hand because it will diminish their effectiveness against a weaponized strain if one was to show up. 


The WHO isn't acting on it yet, during the largest mass migration on earth So they are letting it happen.

I'm not here to get into why she did what she did. Technically speaking, as far as her guilt is concerned, it doesn't matter. This post is to point out that the media was used to sell a false narrative to the public that none of these standards exist to protect such data and that she was not personally subject to them despite being the acting secretary of state.  
example:  [https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-told-fbi-she-thought-classified-markings-were-alphabetical-paragraphs](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-told-fbi-she-thought-classified-markings-were-alphabetical-paragraphs) 

After Clinton's crimes were made public, the subsequent cover up and trial-by-media had to be orchestrated from the top down to thwart the legal process already in place on both civilian and military fronts. Doing so undermined the integrity of the entire classified information program to anyone who uses it. Or perhaps it exposed how truly precarious a system is that blindly punishes or absolves defendants based on secret merit and by secret officiators? Regardless, Clinton's espionage was reduced to a partisan issue in order to baffle the public. It was never a partisan issue.",conspiracy,Hillary Clintons guilt demystified

 This  video is shot be Chen Qiushi. He is a famous ""citizen journalist"". He  went to Wuhan before the city was locked down. He uploaded lots of  videos to report first hand what is happening in Wuhan. This is his  latest video and he is scared!!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXozpbomAns&amp;t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXozpbomAns&amp;t=2s)

The video is in Chinese, does anyone know how to add English cc?

 

This  video is reporting on what he saw on 29th January, it's long and less  constructive than his usual videos, and is more of a rant, I broke it  down into several points below:

1. Censorship

He  acknowledge that he's now being censored on weibo. Apparently just  saying the initials of his names or a picture of him is enough to get  you banned. He said that his new weibo account got banned again. He also  said this video is longer than his usual 5 mins video because those are  intented to be shared on wechat, but now its pointless because wechat  censored him.

2) Medical supplies

The  medical supplies situation is horrible, the hospitals received packages  of all sizes from all over the country. He mentioned that small  packages is probably more a bothersome than help because all the  hospitals need to assign people to unpack them, then organise the  supplies into different categories.

3) Hospitals

The  hospitals have less people compared to the days before. He said this is  more likely to be caused by the lack of transport in the city and that  most people are being self-quarantine at home. He followed someone who's  suspected to caught the virus for a day, they went to 5 to 6 hospitals,  and the situations is too chaos, and the queue to getting tests is  still very long. The person he follows talked to a doctor, who had an  argument with them that they need to show proper reports to get  diagnosed because of the lack of test kits. Despite that, the hospitals  are still mostly in order, and the doctors, nurses, security guards are  being as polite as they can. One of the hospital he went to have beds on  the hallways, in front of the toilet, everywhere. And 70% of the people  there are on oxygen supplementation. There's also someone he talked to  that said the people in the hospitals are being dispensed because the  premier of China, Li Keqiang is coming to visit them. **In  the hospital, he saw a woman holding up someone who's siting on a  wheelchair, and the person on wheelchair has no mask on, the woman said  he's already dead and they are waiting for the transport to come get  him. (He showed the footage for this)**

4) The constructions of the field hospitals

The  construction workers are pushing themselves to the extreme to build the  hospitals. A guy he interviewed said he only slept 2-3 hours everyday  in the past 3 days. There's multiple construction firms working on it at  the same time, and he thinks that might be a problem because of the  high quality requirement for the hospitals. He also answered the  question of some people had about why not just turn existing  hotels/apartments into hospitals: A proper quarantine hospitals are  divided into three areas: green/yellow/red. With the reds being  diagnosed and severe, and green being suspected cases. The red area  requires air tight rooms to prevent air with virus from going outside,  and proper water treatment equipment for the same reason. Which isn't  possible in normal hotels.

5) The news

He  said that the Chinese media does reports the situation, however, all of  the reporters are in full isolation gowns, and they are doing  interviews through phones, and they also only does interviews in the  green area (see the previous paragraph). Because he had no proper  training, he had to try and find some investigate journalist on twitter  to get some tips on how to do proper reporting, and he touch on how rare  it is to find those in China. He also said that he saw on the news that  a reporter from a Hong Kong media is in the city too, so he did all he  could to find that person's wechat, but the HK reporter said that he  didn't left his hotel in the past few days, because the company he works  for don't want their employees to take that risk. That's when he  realise he's truly alone in this.

6) Japanese people in Wuhan

He  briefly touched on that he knows a couple people from the Japanese  embassy, they helped him get to Japan in the past. He called them and  wanted to ask about the people who are going back to Japan, but the  embassy said they couldn't help him. He said he haven't read the news  yet, but it's very important to know that how many people among these  200 are infected.

7) On himself

He  said he's starting to freak out, because the situation does seems  pretty dire. He repeats several times in the video that he only reports  on either what he see directly, or from direct sources like the families  of the infected. And he said while the situation has put a lot of  pressure on him, especially since he has been reporting in hospitals for  the past few days with just goggles, face masks and his coat that he  disinfect regularly, he will try his back get back on his feet. And as  long as he's alive, he will keep reporting the truth. He said both the  Justice Bureau and the police called him to look for him. They also  contacted his parents. He admits that while he's afraid, as he's stuck  between the virus and the criminal justice system of China, he'll say  this: ""FUCK YOU! I'm not even afraid of death! Why do you think I'm  afraid of the Communist Party?!""

 

One point I forgot: the transport

He  mentioned that since all private transportation are stopped, taxis  became the main transportation in the city. Each streets in Wuhan has 4  taxis assigned to it, however he says that that number is not even close  to being enough because of the amount of people living on one street is  like tens of thousands. He also said that he was added into a taxi  driver chat group, and the taxi drivers know about the virus since mid  to late December, some of them stopped shopping at that wet market  completely because of this. And he also said that lack of transport  might be one of the reason that less people are going to the hospital",conspiracy,Firsthand video from Wuhan from Chinese Journlaist  China Coverup Coronavirus

We’ve all seen it. Be it YouTube, Facebook, even here on reddit.  

It seems more than ever all the low tier preroll adds you see are vastly adds for mobile games that look like utter trash.

They all advertise through one of a few themes. It’s either poor acting of people playing the game,  the “how to loot” puzzle game add, or just blatant false advertising of gameplay.

I understand that the AppStore and mobile games are pretty much solely supported by whales, or just a general small section of the user base that buys into MTXs.

But some of these games are just straight up dog doo, and are so obviously  riddled with pay to win/advance/speed up tactic that there’s no reason to play the game without spending money.  And while I do believe that there are valid players using these games and potentially buying into MTXs. To support all the add space these apps occupy has to cost a good amount of money. 

** So here’s the take.**

These games, at least a few of them, must be used as some form of digital money laundering.  There’s just no want they have the popularity to support all these adds and take up so much of my timeline. 

To me it makes sense, there are so many ways that money is stolen digitally, taking that money and validating it has to be filtered in some way to get it clean and what better way that payrolling some shitty app developer to generate a stolen asset AppStore game.

Africa, however, did not care well. By 2022, over a million people across 48 African countries died after being infected with the Wuhan Virus, with more than 3 million being infected in total. The rapid spread of the virus and high mortality rate in Africa was purely down to poverty, lack of healthcare and poor containment.

- China decided to quarantine Wuhan when there were “only” around 500 infected and 17 deaths.
From [this](https://www.google.fr/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/01/26/health/quarantine-china-coronavirus/index.html) CNN article:
The shutdown of Wuhan is ""utterly incredible,"" Howard Markel, professor and director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan, told CNN. “I've never seen an entire city 11.4 million people cordoned off like that,"" Markel said. ""I thought I'd seen everything.""
Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization's Center on Global Health Law, said the move was ""unprecedented,"" and, he thought, ""very unwise"". ""Nothing on this scale has ever been tried,"" he told CNN. 

- So in a country where 24000 people die every day, 4400 only from pollution, they quarantine 60 million people for just a flu with 17 deaths?

What reason could they have?
- (The only) One possible explanation is that they knew something else.
- And the (only) most plausible reason for them to know the seriousness of it is that the virus “escaped” from the lab (maybe an infected worker or animal?) and the lab informed the government about the seriousness of the virus  and the need for quarantine.

Chapter 19: The Light

January 30, 2020

My writing adventures are almost over! I can't wait until I finish because most of the feedback that I receive is abuse. After I finish a chapter, I advertise it publicly. And this always results in receiving a great deal of abuse from idiots who don't even read the entire chapter. The majority of the time they respond exactly how I say that they are going to respond in the chapter. People's evil actions against me always verifies my findings. But I am not for them. I am for the few. I don't care if 99% of what I receive is abuse. Because I am only for the 1%. But it takes great character to not take their insults to heart. In fact, if people respond in a hurtful way towards me, then they are immediately reaped and blocked.

But the scope of reaping souls extends far beyond that. To begin with, I do not need to tell the individuals that I reaped their souls. I just do that for show. It happens automatically. But the reaps don't only occur when people are rude to me. I have successfully reaped a soul when they read or watch my content and don't take its information to heart. All they have to do is read a few sentences and if they could care less about the vital information it carries, that is a successful reap. I intentionally put my material out there to reap the souls of those who possess no heart. For heart is the only thing that can save this planet. And we need to remove the souls from this world that have no heart. Reaping souls is a very real thing. For God sees all and God sees my reaps and the reasoning behind those reaps. People are stupid for not putting one and one together. It is their own damn fault and will result in their eternal damnation.

I am tired of constantly getting banned from places. My content is not welcome anywhere I go. Most communities will remove me from theirs. This is so annoying. I can't get my work out there because this world will not let me. After posting my final chapter I will be so relieved! It will mean the end of the constant abuse that I receive from the public because I will no longer be promoting my work. In the future, they will come to me and not I them. Posting my chapters on a public forum opens me up to abuse. The end is nigh! I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. One day I will be respected as an individual and not treated like trash on a regular basis. I look forward to that day where I no longer have to put up with the constant abuse. I have been receiving it since 2012. That will end in 2020.

The general public refuses to acknowledge me as a philosopher despite that being my major at university. The general public refuses to acknowledge me as a filmmaker, yet I have released countless films. The general public refuses to acknowledge me as an author even though I have written five books. How intelligent is the general public? How much sense does the general public make? Do not trust the collective for they execute prophets. There is no godliness in the opinions of the many. Question all social axioms as they are usually propoganda tools and are usually highly inaccurate. Do not allow the collective to take over your mind. Reject all mainstream celebrities. Stop watching their television. Avoid their employment system if you can. Don't get caught up in feeding the capitalistic system: live as a minimalist and don't focus your life around money. Do not immerse yourself in watching sports, for that practice encourages idolatry, gambling, unhealthy competition, and monotony. Try your best to avoid advertisements when you can, for they work on your subconscious. Avoid friendships that do not share your enthusiasm for virtue. It is better to be alone like I am than to have friends who bring you down as a result of their character. Those we spend most of our time around we become like. If you want to be a unique individual, spend a lot of time alone. Time alone is also excellent for inspiration. Spending a lot of time alone will shape you into your true self. Spending time with the wicked will rub wickedness off onto you. Be very careful about the experiences in which you choose in life. For they will shape your character.

Do not be afraid of death. Stand up to all forms of oppression. Put your life on the line without question when combatting those who are sinful.   Living in fear will turn you away from God. I am not scared of anyone or anything. I have faced all of my fears and now I have none. I am never frightened of standing up for what is right even when this lands me in prison. I am not afraid of the police who spend their days harrassing the virtuous. I don't care if someone has a gun, even when it is pointed at me. Go ahead and kill me. Let's see those results. I am not afraid of being robbed on the street. I would tell them to fuck off or kill me. They are getting my possessions over my dead body. This mentality is liberating. You will die whenever it is your time. This does not mean that you should provoke death. Allow what happens to happen and refuse to take any abuse despite who they are or what they want from you. Treat everyone impartially. Listen to what they want and if it invades your autonomy then stand up for yourself. I am not condoning violence. But I am advising you to not let others push you around.

In my childhood I learned a very important lesson that I will never forget. We always choose where we are. If you become uncomfortable somewhere, leave. It matters not if you get stuck somewhere or miss a ride home. What matters is that you are safe from the people that are hurting you. You can always walk away from any situation. It matters not what situation you are in or where you are. You can always find your way back home. Or you can always leave home. We always have choices and oftentimes just walking away from the situation is the best option. Do not allow others to make you feel like you are trapped. You never have to do anything that you don't want to. You never have to be somewhere that you don't want to be. Liberate your mind by liberating yourself from the enslavement of others. Do not endure hardship just to please another who is treating you poorly. Remember that you always choose where you are and this will avoid you much pain. I have gotten out of the car on a busy highway very far from my house before and then I spent the entire day walking home. I have walked away from fake friends who tried to force me to sin. Blackmail does not work on people like us. Neither does bribery. There is nothing another can do to corrupt me. Protect your heart with your life, for it is more valuable than your life. Don't let others blacken your heart, for that will have eternal consequences. Become like the wind and wend. Do not value the material but instead the spiritual.

I have spent my entire life outside of society looking down upon it and analysing it for clues as to why things are so bad. Something I have noticed is that society drives people away from one another. It is really difficult now days to find a friend who you trust. Divorce rates are half and most couples I see are unhappy with each other and their lives. People are unhappy everywhere I go. I am always happy and I want to share my happiness with others. I found the key to happiness in life and I made enough copies for everyone. I am disappointed by how miserable people are in this world and this causes me to work very hard to help others see the light. I know that I am controversial but I can't wake you up until I slap you out of your slumber. Despite what I have said throughout my work, I deeply care for people and want to see the best for them in life. Why else would I expend so much effort to bring this material to you, especially when I am constantly abused for it? I am trying my best to save the world and as a result the individuals within the world. But I can't do it without you. Please help me save the world.

And that is exactly what my work is: a solid attempt to save the world. Imagine if a lot of people spent their lives trying to save the world. Suddenly, delusions of grandeur become a reality. What I am unable to do alone we can do together. But our objective must be clear and not watered down. The objective is to save the world. We must not let this objective go despite what labels the doctors place upon us. The doctors are the ones who are insane by incarcerating and torturing those who spend their lives trying to save the world. Why would anyone try to save the world when fake doctors are punishing them for doing so? This practice discourages people from attempting to save the world because apparently that is a mental illness. Be very sceptical of everything mainstream society tells you. For most of it was created with a devious agenda behind it. The social elite are trying to send everybody to Hell by encouraging wicked practices within society and discouraging acts of virtue. Those on the top doing this to you are spiritual people. They are not atheists or agnostics. In fact, they are Satan worshippers. I have studied a great deal into the occult. They are controlling and directing this world. And their greatest weapon is sexual immorality.

Sexual immorality directly results in wicked people and the occult know this. So they structure their media to encourage this behaviour, normalising it to such an extent that now days it is unheard of to be a virgin until your marriage. They might not yet openly encourage polygamy but they do openly encourage promiscuous behaviour, moving from partner to partner, trying out their sexual organs like they were on display at a store. I have had two sexual partners in my life and I regret both of them. One was my ex-wife who left me. The other was my ex-fiance who also left me. I only ever wanted one sexual partner in my life but I failed at that because these women did not appreciate how obsessed I was with virtue. I failed and this was my fault. I should have waited for the perfect match. Instead, I worked with what was available. I did not see the perfect match anywhere so I settled. Do not settle in a relationship. Find your soul mate or be alone. Jumping from sexual partner to sexual partner will corrupt your soul. For when love is reduced to mere infatuation and sexual satisfaction, the meaning of love is lost. Those who have had many sexual partners have no ability to love. They are merely saying words that they understand nothing of. To truly love another one must love their soul. If one does not believe in souls then love is not a possibility for that person. If one does not love themselves then they can never love another.

Most people in this world hate themselves. This is because they live selfish lives and it is not possible to be happy when invested in this type of lifestyle. The only way to obtain true happiness in life is to give your life over to the public. A life wasted is a life entirely invested in themselves and no one else. Do not fool yourself into thinking that selfish desires like having a family or working in an employment system is a compassionate cause. Helping your friends when they are in need is also not a compassionate cause. Most activities in life in which we collectively consider compassionate causes are not. Even most charities are operated by the rich and as a result are structured to get the rich richer and the poor poorer. There are so many activities in this world that are disguised to appear as if they are a compassionate cause when in fact they are hurting our society. This is why you must be careful of who you donate to. For you will be held responsible for your actions if you make the world a worse place by investing in a ""compassionate"" cause. In order to truly love yourself you need to have a clear conscience. You need to know that the actions you take in life are truly a good cause. I recommend not donating to typical charities. Instead, create your own charitable investments and watch them come to fruition. Only invest in a charity external of you when you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that what they are doing is in fact good and not evil. Do not be tricked for there will be consequences.

I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. A life free from constant abuse is so near! Sure, that means that I will no longer be advertising my work which means that many will miss out. But I have spent ten years trying to reach everybody I could. Ten years of constant abuse is enough for me. All those in my future can find me or miss out. The work is all publicly available. It just means that people will have to come to me instead of I them. I apologise to those who will miss out because of this development but there is only so much abuse one can take before they have to flee from the people inflicting the abuse. And I did not stop in the middle of something. My work came to its natural conclusion. It is like a television show finale that also came to its natural conclusion. The shows are always there publicly available to anyone who wishes to experience them, however, they will no longer be promoted. I pray for search results to one day lift their shadow ban on me. But this likely will not happen because my content is so controversial. As a result, I must rely on word of mouth from the individuals in which I did manage to reach over the last ten years. There is a point where we are required to give the rest to God and allow things to be as they will be. One person can only move the world so much. It takes an army to change it.

I am creating an army to combat the end times. If you are interested in joining me, please invest yourself into my work and follow its directions. I give very clear instructions albeit spread throughout my work. But it is created like this in order to train you to become a mighty warrior. One who is weak cannot help in this war. My work was created to make you strong. Use my work to become strong. Open your mind and allow it to brainwash you. For there is no better way of thinking. My work was created to brainwash not only myself but also others who are interested in flipping their lives around. In truth, the work is designed to reverse the brainwashing that society has already inflicted upon you. How much do you value your soul? You will not regret investment into it. For its rewards are infinite. Do not work for the material but instead the spiritual. What you cannot see bears much greater significance on your life than what you can see. Most are just blind to this truth. Why do you think this world is so miserable? Because the material is unable to fill the void in your soul.

We live in a simulated world. Everything here has been designed to test your spirit. For God will only allow those who are worthy to live in His presence. God had to find a way to separate His whites from His blacks. Heaven could not be possible if everyone was allowed in. Heaven had to be created from the righteous souls because evil ones would corrupt it. In order to safeguard this haven, only the best of the best were allowed in. Do not feel sorry for those who have damned their own souls. If God allowed those who are unworthy to enter into His Kingdom then it would not be heaven. People oftentimes remark how a good God would allow everyone into heaven. But such a place would be called Hell. It is not possible to create a righteous environment from those who are wicked. Our souls will return where they belong. If you want to live in a paradise after your death then you have to obtain the qualities of said paradise. It is not like we will die and then change who we are. Our souls will act how they were trained to and if they were trained to be evil then the soul will be released to others trained in the same manner. Evil souls will torture each other after their death. And good souls will live harmoniously together under the rule of God. It is not possible for an evil soul to become good after its death. As a result it ends up where it belongs. The statement that a good God wouldn't damn anyone is cryptically true. Because the souls damn themselves through the actions in which they take in life. There is no paradise in the afterlife for those who refused to implement paradise here on Earth. Such a notion of saving those who spent their lives committing sin is nonsensical. They would ruin our heaven if they were to be allowed in. As a result, there souls will end up in the blackness in which they cast in life.

But I see such great potential in you! You can live eternity in paradise with me! We can spend forever getting to know each other and working together to create the best heaven possible. There is no sleep in heaven and as a result we must occupy our time with projects that are meaningful. God has promised me my own world in which I can form and shape in heaven. Maybe we could build it together? Or maybe you would like your own world to craft? The heavens are the limits. You need only become worthy of the task you wish to perform in heaven. Build your life here on Earth to prepare for your life in heaven. An eternity is a long time to prepare for. Those who spend their lives in boredom cannot enter the kingdom of heaven. Because how could you be happy for eternity if you are unable to find meaningful things to do with your time? Seize the day! Carpe diem! You only have one life to prove that you are worthy of heaven. Do not waste it.

98,Better_Understanding,ew12ar,"The output of sense organs is first received by the thalamus. Part of the thalamus' stimuli goes directly to the amygdala or ""emotional/irrational brain"", while other parts are sent to the neocortex or ""thinking/rational brain"". If the amygdala perceives a match to the stimulus, i.e., if the record of experiences in the hippocampus tells the amygdala that it is a fight, flight or freeze situation, then the amygdala triggers the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis and hijacks the rational brain. This emotional brain activity processes information milliseconds earlier than the rational brain, so in case of a match, the amygdala acts before any possible direction from the neocortex can be received. If, however, the amygdala does not find any match to the stimulus received with its recorded threatening situations, then it acts according to the directions received from the neocortex. When the amygdala perceives a threat, it can lead that person to react irrationally and destructively.

Goleman states that emotions ""make us pay attention right now—this is urgent—and gives us an immediate action plan without having to think twice. The emotional component evolved very early: Do I eat it, or does it eat me?"" The emotional response ""can take over the rest of the brain in a millisecond if threatened.""An amygdala hijack exhibits three signs: strong emotional reaction, sudden onset, and post-episode realization if the reaction was inappropriate.

Goleman later emphasized that ""self-control is crucial...when facing someone who is in the throes of an amygdala hijack"" so as to avoid a complementary hijacking—whether in work situations or in private life. Thus for example 'one key marital competence is for partners to learn to soothe their own distressed feelings...nothing gets resolved positively when husband or wife is in the midst of an emotional hijacking.'  The danger is that ""when our partner becomes, in effect, our enemy, we are in the grip of an 'amygdala hijack' in which our emotional memory, lodged in the limbic center of our brain, rules our reactions without the benefit of logic or reason...which causes our bodies to go into a 'fight or flight' response.""

t.
the roman optimum: stability from c. 100 b.c. to 200 a.d. Exceptional climate stability characterizes the centuries of the Ro- man Empire’s rise; certain regions enjoyed unusually favorable conditions. In the western Roman Empire, the arst century b.c. through the arst and possibly second century a.d. were warmer than later centuries. Archaeological evidence from Britain, ice- core data from Greenland, and dendrodata about summer temperatures 


from Austria all agree on this score, as does the fact that the Alpine glaciers were retreating and, in the arst and second cen- tury a.d., relatively small, comparable probably to their extent c. 2000 a.d. Two potential climate-forcing factors both show un- usual stability. Within the generally even level of solar activity be- tween c. 200 b.c. and 600 a.d., the centuries from 200 b.c. to 100 a.d. stand out as particularly stable (Figure 1a). An exception- ally low level of volcanic activity also prevailed from c. 40 b.c. to 150 a.d. (Figure 2b). In central Greenland, temperatures became warm from c. 20 b.c. to c. 75 a.d. A stable, relatively cool period followed from c. 100 to c. 270 a.d. (Figure 2c). The speleothem in Austria’s Spannagel Cave indicates stable conditions until about 250 a.d. (Figure 1b). Written sources from about 75 b.c. to c. 175 a.d. emphasize moisture (Figure 6a), predominantly in the form of the oooding of the Tiber River recorded at Rome. Pre- cipitation in northeastern France was stable and largely balanced, ouctuating within narrow margins, also until about 250 a.d. (Fig- ure 5b). Quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions deduced from pollen deposits in the Eifel maars (lakes formed from extinct vol- canoes) also point to a stable climate pattern overall (Figures 3 and 4).6
In detail, the chloride (Cl-) levels from Greenland indicate that sea ice retreated, implying that warming occurred between about 15 b.c. and 40 a.d. Cooling resumed with sea-ice expan- sion, peaking c. 70 a.d. before renewed warming in the last years of the arst century (Figure 2a). The Greenland ice cores signal slow, slight cooling starting in the second century a.d. and contin- uing to about 270, implying longer winters in the North Atlantic (Figure 2c; cf. Figure 11). The Austrian alpine dendrodata indi- cate that the warm summer temperatures c. 85 b.c. cooled until c. 35 b.c., followed by general warming interrupted by some cool years c. 20 a.d. and again between about 75 and 93, perhaps re- lated to the Vesuvian eruption that destroyed Pompeii in 79 a.d. (Figure 5a). Nevertheless, the Alpine glaciers experienced a long retreat, and warm temperatures dominated in the Austrian Alps through the second century, punctuated by further cool spells

134,Rhodies_never_die_,evzbs7,"I keep seeing this point pushed, but it is entirely false.

This entire situation stems back to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in WW1. T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) was sent to the Hijaz to rally the Arab tribes against their Ottoman overlords. In exchange for opening up another front against the Ottomans, the Arabs were promised Palestine. The Arabs were actually remarkably successful, but that's a story for another time. 
However, the English had other plans, much to Colonel Lawrence's chagrin, if the sources are to be believed. Arthur Balfour, the British foreign secretary, negotiated with Lord Rothschild, who stood as a representative of the international bankers, to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. This led to the issuance of the Balfour Declaration.
His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. 2 November 1917
This was effectively the birth of Israel, notice the date, still in the middle of WW1, but everybody knew that Palestine would be under British mandate because the Sykes-Picot agreement was signed the year prior. Obviously you can see why this greatly angered the Arabs in the region, they had effectively paid for that land in blood. I also believe that they had a hand in the Sykes-Picot agreement, it effectively neutered Muslim power in the region. I think they purposely split the Middle East into divided, weak countries to better set the stage for the coming of Israel.
Now this is where it gets interesting. What did Lord Rothschild offer Arthur Balfour in exchange for a Jewish state in Palestine? What could be so valuable to drive the British foreign secretary to establish a new state, effectively out of thin air? This is the theory I support, presented to me by my Middle Eastern history instructor at USMA. The bankers used their influence to drag the isolationist US into WW1, in exchange for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. Remember that Germany wanted peace talks in late 1916, and the British refused, despite being beaten badly on all fronts. We entered the war 6 months later. I think that the establishment of Israel was payment for this, it seems that they paid for Israel with OUR blood. This is the only connection the US has with the establishment of Israel.",conspiracy,America was not responsible for the creation of Israel

Huge Kobe fan and celebrity deaths don’t usually phase me, but this one hit home as I have spent 20 of my 27 years watching Kobe play basketball. Might be denial but hard to come to terms with the details of this tragedy. 

There are reports of (only) Kobe and Gianna attending mass at 7 AM Sunday morning. The helicopter departed at 9:05 AM to the Camarillo Airport outside the Mamba academy. It was noted the helicopter took an alternate route in which the helicopter had never taken before prior to the crash in an open field. 

A catastrophic crash taking a new, alternate route, leaving no survivors and witnesses coming through dense fog where camera footage would be at a minimum seems very sketchy to me. Not to mention this aircraft had no TWS (Terrain Warning System) and onboard black box recording (which makes it harder to confirm Kobe/Gianna were both onboard). 

Do we have information and details on Kobe and Gianna’s whereabouts between Sunday Mass and boarding the helicopter (texts, cell phone pings, etc.) ? Do we have speculations as to why the helicopter dove at 167 mph into the ground?

You may or may not know but Obama and his parents always say that he was born in Hawaii because you have to be born in the US to be president.  And the whole argument is he wasn’t born there because all his relatives and rest of his family say he was born in Africa, more specifically Kenya.  And I mean, Kenya is pretty damn close to the Middle East.  And for Meghan, the whore of Babylon is said to come from the west.  And Meghan was an American actress before marrying prince Harry.  America=West.  Also, the whore of Babylon is supposed to be publicly nice and kind but actually evil.  And you can look up the fact that her family on her side talks about how nasty and mean she can be to people in private.

As someone with a little bit of medical and forensic expertise, here are a few reasons I believe why, feel free to CMV.

1. Bioweapons are never intended to be released at epicenter locations. Assailants rely on convenience, ease of infection, and incubation periods to spark the fire and do most of the damage. Everything that follows is a step-ladder of consequences. But why Wuhan? Is it their virology lab? Probably not. Not all weapons need to be manufactured and incubated in a lab, in this case it was 'simply' cross-infection with an animal-linked pathogen. Again, the incubation period is what matters. The fact that a virology lab was next door and this non-human virus was incubating publicly for this long is what the concern should be, not whether or not the laboratory deliberately constructed it. In other countries, this would be seen as criminal negligence since it's impossible for an institute of that caliber to exist and not notice something afoot within the local populace, experts HAD to know. Either they were powerless to say anything, or were forced not to. 

2. To obfuscate the nature of the weapon and avoid public backlash. Covert infiltration relies on back channels in order to remain effective through secrecy. This is why bioweapons have remained effective for decades, because nobody ever gets the time to raise suspicion into if an outbreak was a targeted attack. The only people left to deal with reality are future historians.

Deflation, on the other hand, is good for the exact inverse: it increases your currency's value and allows you to buy more with the dollars you already have, the increased savings promote investment, and it rewards people like lenders and savers who aren't idiots with money.  Gold is naturally deflationary, so a gold currency is best.

It stands to reason that the American people have ceased to have a truly free market backed by sound economics since 1913 with the dual strangulation of the federal income tax and the Federal Reserve.  All of the inflation since then has rewarded useless public sector workers and welfare sponges who don't work, while squeezing the producer class into virtual nonexistence.

The information they gathered beforehand, came from intelligence assets involved with Soleimani and involved with Taliban.

Those assets were located in Taliban territory in Afghanistan. 

The helicopter that crashed in Afghanistan, was conducting an Intelligence operation when it was shot down. They were using listening devices to receive ground information from the assets in the Taliban encampment.

6 people died in the incident. Including 4 operatives and 2 pilots. 2 were CIA and the others were Marines.

If you ever need proof of human gullibility, cast your mind back to the attack of the flesh-eating bananas. In January 2000, a series of chain emails began reporting that imported bananas were infecting people with “necrotizing fasciitis” – a rare disease in which the skin erupts into livid purple boils before disintegrating and peeling away from muscle and bone.

According to the email chain, the FDA was trying to cover up the epidemic to avoid panic. Faced with the threat, readers were encouraged to spread the word to their friends and family.

The threat was pure nonsense, of course. But by 28 January, the concern was great enough for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a statement decrying the rumour.

Did it help? Did it heck. Rather than quelling the rumour, they had only poured fuel on its flames. Within weeks, the CDC was hearing from so many distressed callers it had to set up a banana hotline. The facts became so distorted that people eventually started to quote the CDC as the source of the rumour. Even today, new variants of the myth have occasionally reignited those old fears.


After all, humans are naturally drawn to the titillating and sensational. Think car wrecks, plane crashes, people being scammed out of their life savings. Women’s Health writer Zahra Barnes attributes this allure to the human instinct. For one, seeing other people’s pain helps reassure us of our own safety. And it also allows us to experience a form of emotional escapism. She compares the exhilaration of hearing about other people’s tragedies to the that of riding a roller coaster:

     “When you're on an amusement park ride and plummeting toward what feels like certain death, you're in it for the thrill of being terrified—without putting yourself in the face of any real danger.”

Just like the movies, we come to view other people’s pain as entertainment. 

While science may have an easy explanation for why people can’t turn away from tragedy, the real question for me is, why are some people so gullible in the first place?

This fresh Chinese Coronavirus outbreak strikes me as a false story or even maybe a falseflag op. It was conveniently timed for maximal impact ( Chinese new year, HK, Taiwan tensions etc), on best area ( Wuhan - frequent human traffic and bio-tech companies etc).Media response carries characteristic ""attack"" signature fake solidarity and care.

Moreover:

* Wherever one looks, USA and Israel etc are never far away. For example:  
[Biotech Chinese and Israeli Strategic Collaboration: Pontifax and WuXi PharmaTech (Cayman) Inc. (NYSE: WX)](https://pharmaceuticalintelligence.com/2014/11/03/biotech-chinese-and-israeli-strategic-collaboration-pontifax-and-wuxi-pharmatech-cayman-inc-nyse-wx/)
* This is not the first time China is exposed to this. During WWII, Japan has held many Chinese in their concentratioin camp, formed with bioweapon development as a sole purpose. They were used people as a simple biomass for whatever they needed ( [UNIT-731](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731) ). Compared to Unit-731, Aushwitz looked like a bootcamp. After the war, USA snatched the results of their work, giving leading researchers an asylum. 
* Chinese primary strength is copy-cat art, not original development.
* There were some news not that long ago about US military (Navy?) looking around for specific Russian genotypes
* Even \_if\_ original leakage is from Chinese biotech farm, the company itself was formed after importing key people, technologies and data abroad.
* EU is being aggressively cleansed during last few years. Basic tool for this is surveillance network and tech for area protection. People are constantly evaluated and those that fall below certain level are silently removed. It is not uncommon sight to see whole groups of ""civilians"", poisoning unsuspecting target's food while shopping, trying to infect it with mist and saliva etc.  
Good point of dotting the i was, if initial attack is succesful and target needs medical attention, to repeat the attack in waiting room etc.  

* The used to use common pathogens and simple bio-tools (contaminating food with feces, using simple poisons, or prevalent virii of the opportunity). This meant substantial protection, they had to be immune or disinfected, frequently they had to use eye antiseptic ( characteristic ""red eyes"" etc). Nowadays they use less and less protectionn, which means that bio agents are more and more targeted.
* It looks like surveillance network is used for this. Once target is marked as ""terrorist"" and put under constant surveillance, it is not difficult to plan point of attack and choose particular  compound. After the attack, they monitor targets response in real-time. Data goes through the network up to developers, which use the data for next batch.
* They seem to abuse DNA evidence materials for this purpose. It used to be that they collected is just for identification of suspicious individuals. Then came IA and started to massively use it for evidence planting ( drug traffic, pedophilia etc). And now they seem to be using it for biowarfare.

Questions:

* If this is a part of bio-weapon development, how likely is it that Chinese are simply trying to catch with the west ?
* What is the current state of the art on the west ? How targeted and predictable can these weapons be ?
* What would be the primary purpose of using such weapons ?

A few days ago, while I was browsing through conspiracy videos on YouTube, it recommended to me a video on a board game.
At first, I just wanted to get back to the videos about WW1.
However, maybe it was fate, or just a glitch, the recommended video was about a board game called Ultimate Werewolf.
Unfortunately, I will not post links here.
Moreover, the original version of werewolf had another name: Mafia.
The very essence of game play is on information asymmetry.
Unfortunately, I will admit that the real world is not played by only two teams.
Although, i wish it was that simple (us vs TPTB).
We at r Conspiracy is at a information disadvantage.
And if you disagree, then I wish to ask you to start naming names of the TPTB.
After all, we are not at a disadvantage, so we must be able to name them all, right?
Even worse, the moderators in the real world cannot prevent the werewolves from cheating, if the moderators even exist or not compromised.
We don't know who is TPTB and we need to worry about collateral damages, unless we are willing to sink to the ethics level of TPTB.
If that is the case, we will lose, since they are more experienced in such expressions of violence.
Oh, and the Nash equilibirum can be applied to Mafia game.
To paraphrase , 50 werewolves would have almost a 50% chance to win among ten thousand people.
If only we were so lucky.
By the way, in the game, the werewolves can only kill one person a night.
In the real world, the modern military enables the werewolves to kill more than one person.
Worse, there are assassins, propaganda, and false flags, so you cannot even tell who actually killed who.
So, that 50% chance of victory, TPTB just rigged the so-called coin toss to their favor. And that is assuming only 50 people are part of TPTB.
By the way, the Ultimate Werewolf variant also included vampires.
Chances are we, the villagers, are not just fighting TPTB, we need to fight their competitors as well.
Once again, the information asymmetry kicks in, since we don't even know who the vampires are in the real world. 
And that is assuming there are no variants such as: goblins, ogres, and dragons.
Honestly, our victory condition, if exist, look no where near achievable.
And even if we can properly investigate TPTB without harming innocents, how should TPTB be punished for their crimes?
Life in prison might as well be a slap on the wrist.
And if we bring back the death penalty, how can we make sure such punishment will not be abused in the future.
Humanity can't even properly police themselves now!

https://www.scribd.com/document/326057027/Amended-Complaint-Filed-9-30-2016#from_embed?platform=hootsuite

2) This lawsuit was dropped. Plaintiff’s lawyers say because of intimidation (which is documented behavior in other cases). Skeptics say because there was nothing there. Fair enough.

3) But then we learn that more than two dozen other women have accused President of sexual misconduct, that he describes “grabbing women by the pussy” whenever he wants (something Epstein also used to do BTW) and describing perving on beauty pageant contestants on Howard Stern.

4) Then allegations surface from several Miss **Teen** USA contestants describing exactly the perving the President himself described to Stern. https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2016/oct/18/allegations-about-donald-trump-and-miss-teen-usa-c/

5) It turns out the President is not the only one in the administration directly and closely connected to super-pedophile Epstein.

Also: Barr, Acosta, Ivanka, Mnuchin, Melania, Bannon, Trump Model Management, and Mar-A-Lago. All these “coincidental” connections are solid and verifiable with a quick search.

6) It comes out that Alan Dershowitz and super-pedophile Jeffrey Epstein were indeed close friends. The source?

Why it’s 2003 Alan Dershowitz:

“I’m on my 20th book. The only person outside of my immediate family that I send drafts to is Jeffrey [...] I would be as interested in him as a friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about his ideas.” https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey-epstein-200303

We are the fattest first world  nation in the world.  Hell, we are up there with EVERY nation in the world. I used to be fat, I mean, obese, so I can notice these things much more than the average person.

I truthfully believe we will not have socialized healthcare due to obesity. These people are making too much money on this issue. Heart disease is the #1 killer of Americans, next is cancer. The former being brought on by obesity (or at the very least, accelerated by) . This massive healthcare cost is around 5-10% of healthcare spending. This would be a massive cost for the taxpayer to burden, and that money could be spent on ""better "" things for the government to spend that money on without the taxpayer resisting higher tax burden (ie MIC spending) . 

Not to mention, all the profiteering going on and the incentives (and I am sure, lobbying) to keep people addicted to this crap food. The fact that sugar (HFCS) is in the white bread, says enough. 

Mickey D's, BK, Taco Hell, Coka C, PesiComp, and al th others, have MASSIVE incentives to keep people eating their food, and that added sugar, fat, and salt, keeps people coming back for more. All the damn extra calories are enough to equal an entire meal! Its basically capitalism out of control, knowing that these substances are addictive to the human body due to them being in such low amounts through out history (wild animals are lean and glucose can be rare). 

Nationalized healthcare would force society to take a look at the lack of chooses available and re evaluate them (ie, loss of profits) .

The different of responsibility alone FEELS like a conspiracy when individuals are blames for these lack of choices in a healthy diet (unless you want to cook everything for yourself, or know the calorie content of ALL your food, while fighting an uphill battle against this entire society) .  We all know that the school lunches wee not in the slightest healthy , despite them having plenty of fat and protein (yet little vitamins) . Walking tacos, pizza (the vegetable . HA!), candied apples, burgers, fries, etc...is very telling of our culture. 

Breaking free of this, as a formerly obese person, I realize my mating choices are SEVERELY limited due to being a fit person in an area (the Midwest) full of people who accept the standard and live like I used to (ie, how most of us are FORCED to live) . I know for a fact, It was not at all easy and I admit that during it, I could NOT have done it without HELP! I definitely have an incentive in lowering the obesity rate.

Things to note: 

&gt;&gt;There is currently no vaccine or treatment for the virus and it is spreading rapidly. 

&gt;&gt;Medical experts have warned that a vaccine may not be available for up to a year.

&gt;&gt;In the most severe cases, the virus causes pneumonia, which can spark breathing difficulty, lung inflammation and death.

&gt;&gt;Antibiotics cannot treat viral pneumonia and there is currently no antiviral drugs for the Wuhan coronavirus.


The incubation period is long, about 20-30 days. It can be spread from a few meters away.

The 90s and 2000's  was focused on combating obesity in America, as schools began to remove soda machines and ice cream machines from their cafeterias, moving for more healthy options. By the tail end of the 2000s, America was no longer the most obese country in the world and heart disease rates were rapidly falling.

And then suddenly something changed. Celebrities and social media begin to push the ""woke"" idea of fat people as a race. Health at any size and body positivity begin trending everywhere almost overnight. Comedians like Bill Maher started to get shut down for their fat jokes, and celebrities losing weight quickly went from a PR Miracle to a scandal.

Most of the users on Reddit pushing this shit had zero Post history, and the change was so sudden it seems extremely unlikely that it was organic. Obese celebrities have begun rising to the top of the charts, many of whom had little to no Talent.

Cut to 2019 and every single Elementary School in the country has soda and snack machines back in their cafeterias. My University shut down its sushi/smoothie bar and reopened it as a McDonalds.

Taking a look back at our history, there are plenty of examples of large monolithic Industries trying to inject their product into pop culture for acceptance. Look at the cigarette companies! They spent billions funding social campaigns and phony health studies to make sure that their products were seeing as trendy healthy. They didn't give a shit that they were killing people, so long as they made a profit.

Snack companies certainly have a lot to gain by this. All through the 90s and 2000's they were spending billions into alternate more healthy organic recipes to their snacks so they wouldn't cause as much obesity. These same companies have pretty much abandoned these projects at this point.

By weaving fat acceptance into cancel culture, they have pretty much guaranteed that they will continue killing people for the foreseeable future as obese Americans gladly die on the altar of there now socially approved hedonism.",conspiracy,Snack companies used social media to push the fat acceptance movement in the exact same way the tobacco company is pushed cigarettes

364,ShellOilNigeria,evp97x,"THERE’S WIDESPREAD CONCERN that video cameras will use facial recognition software to track our every public move. Far less remarked upon — but every bit as alarming — is the exponential expansion of “smart” video surveillance networks.

Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance. In the not-so-distant future, police forces, stores, and city administrators hope to film your every move — and interpret it using video analytics.

The rise of all-seeing smart camera networks is an alarming development that threatens civil rights and liberties throughout the world. Law enforcement agencies have a long history of using surveillance against marginalized communities, and studies show surveillance chills freedom of expression — ill effects that could spread as camera networks grow larger and more sophisticated.

To understand the situation we’re facing, we have to understand the rise of the video surveillance industrial complex — its history, its power players, and its future trajectory. It begins with the proliferation of cameras for police and security, and ends with a powerful new industry imperative: complete visual surveillance of public space.

Video Management Systems and Plug-in Surveillance Networks
In their first decades of existence, CCTV cameras were low-resolution analog devices that recorded onto tapes. Businesses or city authorities deployed them to film a small area of interest. Few cameras were placed in public, and the power to track people was limited: If police wanted to pursue a person of interest, they had to spend hours collecting footage by foot from nearby locations.

In the late 1990s, video surveillance became more advanced. A company called Axis Communications invented the first internet-enabled surveillance camera, which converted moving images to digital data. New businesses like Milestone Systems built Video Management Systems, or VMS, to organize video information into databases. VMS providers created new features like motion sensor technology that alerted guards when a person was caught on camera in a restricted area.

As time marched on, video surveillance spread. On one account, about 50 years ago, the United Kingdom had somewhere north of 60 permanent CCTV cameras installed nationwide. Today, the U.K. has over 6 million such devices, while the U.S. has tens of millions. According to marketing firm IHS Markit, 1 billion cameras will be watching the world by the end of 2021, with the United States rivaling China’s per person camera penetration rate. Police can now track people across multiple cameras from a command-and-control center, desktop, or smartphone.

While it is possible to link thousands of cameras in a VMS, it is also expensive. To increase the amount of CCTVs available, cities recently came up with a clever hack: encouraging businesses and residents to place privately owned cameras on their police network — what I call “plug-in surveillance networks.”

By pooling city-owned cameras with privately owned cameras, policing experts say an agency in a typical large city may amass hundreds of thousands of video feeds in just a few years.
Detroit has popularized plug-in surveillance networks through its controversial Project Green Light program. With Project Green Light, businesses can purchase CCTV cameras and connect them to police headquarters. They can also place a bright green light next to the cameras to indicate they are part of the police network. The project claims to deter crime by signaling to residents: The police are watching you.

Detroit is not alone. Chicago, New Orleans, New York, and Atlanta have also deployed plug-in surveillance networks. In these cities, private businesses and/or homes provide feeds that are integrated into crime centers so that police can access live streams and recorded footage. The police department in New Haven, Connecticut, told me they are looking into plug-in surveillance, and others are likely considering it.

The number of cameras on police networks now range from tens of thousands (Chicago) to several hundred (New Orleans). With so many cameras in place, and only a small team of officers to watch them, law enforcement agencies face a new challenge: How do you make sense of all that footage?

The answer is video analytics.

Video Analytics Takes Off
Around 2006, a young Israeli woman was recording family videos every weekend, but as a student and parent, she didn’t have time to watch them. A computer scientist at her university, Professor Shmuel Peleg, told me he tried to create a solution for her: He would take a long video and condense the interesting activity into a short video clip.

His solution failed: It only worked on stationary cameras, and the student’s video camera was moving when she filmed her family.

Peleg soon found another use case in the surveillance industry, which relies on stationary cameras. His solution became BriefCam, a video analytics firm that can summarize video footage from a scene across time so that investigators can view all relevant footage in a short space of time.

Using a feature called Video Synopsis, BriefCam overlays footage of events happening at different times as if they are appearing simultaneously. For example, if several people walked past a camera at 12:30 p.m., 12:40 p.m., and 12:50 p.m., BriefCam will aggregate their images into a single scene. Investigators can view all footage of interest from a given day in minutes instead of hours.

Thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence, summarization is just one feature in BriefCam’s product line and the rapidly expanding video analytics industry.

Behavior recognition includes video analytics capabilities like fight detection, emotion recognition, fall detection, loitering, dog walking, jaywalking, toll fare evasion, and even lie detection.

Object recognition can recognize faces, animals, cars, weapons, fires, and other things, as well as human characteristics like gender, age, and hair color.

Anomalous or unusual behavior detection works by recording a fixed area for a period of time — say, 30 days — and determining “normal” behavior for that scene. If the camera sees something unusual — say, a person running down a street at 3:00 a.m. — it will flag the incident for attention.

Video analytics systems can analyze and search across real-time streams or recorded footage. They can also isolate individuals or objects as they traverse a smart camera network.

Chicago; New Orleans; Detroit; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Hartford, Connecticut, are some of the cities currently using BriefCam for policing.

To Search and Surveil
With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. This provides authorities the power to index and search a vast database of objects, behaviors, and anomalous activity.

In Connecticut, police have used video analytics to identify or monitor known or suspected drug dealers. Sergeant Johnmichael O’Hare, former Director of the Hartford Real-Time Crime Center, recently demonstrated how BriefCam helped Hartford police reveal “where people go the most” in the space of 24 hours by viewing footage condensed and summarized in just nine minutes. Using a feature called “pathways,” he discovered hundreds of people visiting just two houses on the street and secured a search warrant to verify that they were drug houses.

Video analytics startup Voxel51 is also adding more sophisticated searching to the mix. Co-founded by Jason Corso, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, the company offers a platform for video processing and understanding.

Corso told me his company hopes to offer the first system where people can “search based on semantic content about their data, such as, ‘I want to find all the video clips that have more than 3-way intersections … with at least 20 vehicles during daylight.’” Voxel51 “tries to make that possible” by taking video footage and “turning it into structured searchable data across different types of platforms.”

Unlike BriefCam, which analyzes video using nothing but its own software, Voxel51 offers an open platform which allows third parties to add their own analytics models. If the platform succeeds, it will supercharge the ability to search and surveil public spaces.

Corso told me his company is working on a pilot project with the Baltimore police for their CitiWatch surveillance program and plans to trial the software with the Houston Police Department.

As cities start deploying a wide range of monitoring devices from the so-called internet of things, researchers are also developing a technique known as video analytics and sensor fusion, or VA/SF, for police intelligence. With VA/SF, multiple streams from sensors are combined with video analytics to reduce uncertainties and make inferences about complex situations. As one example, Peleg told me BriefCam is developing in-camera audio analytics that uses microphones to discern actions that may confuse AI systems, such as whether people are fighting or dancing.

VMSs also offer smart integration across technologies. Former New Haven Chief of Police Anthony Campbell told me how ShotSpotters, controversial devices that listen for gunshots, integrate with specialized software so when a gun is fired, nearby swivel cameras instantly alter their direction to the location of the weapons discharge.

Officers can also use software to lock building doors from a control center, and companies are developing analytics to alert security if one car is being followed by another.

Toward a “Minority Report” World
Video analytics captures a wide variety of data about the areas covered by smart camera networks. Not surprisingly, the information captured is now being proposed for predictive policing: the use of data to predict and police crime before it happens.

In 2002, the dystopian film “Minority Report” depicted a society using “pre-crime” analytics for police to intervene in lawbreaking before it occurs. In the end, the officers in charge tried to manipulate the system for their own interests.

A real-world version of “Minority Report” is emerging through real-time crime centers used to analyze crime patterns for police. In these centers, law enforcement agencies ingest information from sources like social media networks, data brokers, public databases, criminal records, and ShotSpotters. Weather data is even included for its impact on crime (because “bad guys don’t like to get wet”).

In a 2018 document, the data storage firm Western Digital and the consultancy Accenture predicted mass smart camera networks would be deployed “across three tiers of maturity.” This multi-stage adoption, they contended, would “allow society” to gradually abandon “concerns about privacy” and instead “accept and advocate” for mass police and government surveillance in the interest of “public safety.”

Tier 1 encompasses the present where police use CCTV networks to investigate crimes after-the-fact.

By 2025, society will reach Tier 2 as municipalities transform into “smart” cities, the document said. Businesses and public institutions, like schools and hospitals, will plug camera feeds into government and law enforcement agencies to inform centralized, AI-enabled analytics systems.

Tier 3, the most predictive-oriented surveillance system, will arrive by 2035. Some residents will voluntarily donate their camera feeds, while others will be “encouraged to do so by tax-break incentives or nominal compensation.” A “public safety ecosystem” will centralize data “pulled from disparate databases such as social media, driver’s licenses, police databases, and dark data.” An AI-enabled analytics unit will let police assess “anomalies in real time and interrupt a crime before it is committed.”

That is to say, to catch pre-crime.

Rise of the Video Surveillance Industrial Complex
While CCTV surveillance began as a simple tool for criminal justice, it has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry that covers multiple industry verticals. From policing and smart cities to schools, health care facilities, and retail, society is moving toward near-complete visual surveillance of commercial and urban spaces.

Denmark-based Milestone Systems, a top VMS provider with half its revenues in the U.S., had less than 10 employees in 1999. Today they are a major corporation that claims offices in over 20 countries.

Axis Communications used to be a network printer outfit. They have since become a leading camera provider pushing over $1 billion in sales per year.

BriefCam began as a university project. Now it is among the world’s top video analytics providers, with clients, it says, spanning over 40 countries.

Over the past six years, Canon purchased all three, giving the imaging conglomerate ownership of industry giants in video management software, CCTV cameras, and video analytics. Motorola recently acquired a top VMS provider, Avigilon, for $1 billion. In turn, Avigilon and other large firms have purchased their own companies.

Using a feature called Video Synopsis, BriefCam overlays footage of events happening at different times as if they are appearing simultaneously. For example, if several people walked past a camera at 12:30 p.m., 12:40 p.m., and 12:50 p.m., BriefCam will aggregate their images into a single scene.

He withheld vital foreign assistance for personal political gain. That can’t be allowed to stand."" People don't change their viewpoints this drastically in 24 hours with no new details emerging.  Someone or group of people clearly got to her and forced her to change her viewpoint, which is by definition a conspiracy.

Everyone knows that China recently abolished the one-child policy, but the policy's impact had massive repercussions. The policy led directly to the biggest issue facing China today and especially the future: the gigantic population of retirees that will soon become a reality. The large schism between the old and the young will be devastating to economic growth and create a huge social burden on the working class. So my main point is what if China engineered the Coronavirus to cull the old population in order to prevent future social unrest? We know that the epidemic so far has only killed people older than 55; the communist party has the means and the pragmatism to carry it out. The whole epidemic is just a utilitarian attempt at social engineering.

436,Yaakov117,evlufe,"Wealth is disproportionately concentrated in the hands of global Jewry. Depending on the year in question, the percentage of the Forbes 400 for the four hundred wealthiest Americans is usually around one-third or more despite comprising just 1.5% of the US’s population. In 1987, Nathaniel Weyl found [23%](https://racehist.blogspot.com/2009/10/changes-in-ethnicnational-origins-of.html) of American billionaires were Jewish, whereas for the last decade, the number has settled in at around 35%. In both 2009 and 2013, for example, Jews represented 35% of the list. 11.6% of the world’s billionaires are Jewish, despite Jews accounting for 0.2% of the world’s population. Jews are over 100 times more likely to be billionaires than everyone else on earth. Five of the top seven wealthiest Aussies are Jewish, despite accounting for less than 0.5% of the nation’s population. [20% of Britain’s “Super Rich” are Jewish—and most of them are immigrants](https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/wealthiest-jews-in-britain-were-born-abroad-super-rich-list-reveals-1.54747). All of Monaco’s billionaires are Jewish. Jews are 25% of Canada’s billionaires (at roughly 1% of the population), 13% of Brazil’s (at 0.5% of the population), and 43% of the Ukraine’s (at roughly 1% of the population). Jews are roughly 17 times more likely per capita to make the Forbes 400 than is the rest of the American population. 46% of Jews earn more than $100,000 a year, compared to 19% among all Americans. IQ differential alone is not enough to explain this disparity; the overrepresentation is too dramatic.

[Jews, by the way, are 26.4% of South Africa’s wealthiest individuals whilst representing an absurdly small .014% of the population](https://www.sajr.co.za/news-and-articles/2016/12/12/jews-make-up-26-4-of-sa's-wealthiest-citizens). They have profited enormously from [the diamond trade](https://medium.com/@AspieSavant/when-diamonds-were-a-jew-s-best-friend-bae3d1577ffc). Things are clearly going well for the Jews in South Africa, but for whites it is a different story. Per Henk van de Graaf: “The farmers live in fear, because being a farmer in South Africa is the most dangerous occupation in the world. The average murder ratio per 100,000 for the population in the world is nine, I believe. In South Africa, it is 54. But for the farming community it is 138, which is the highest for any occupation in the world” (Chicago is 28 per 100,000 and St. Louis is 35.3 per 100,000 residents as a point of reference). Whites are less than 9% of the South African population but are 40% of all murder victims. South Africa has a 95% black-on-white murder rate and the world’s highest rape rate. There are government-sanctioned policies to seize land from white farmers and re-distribute it to markedly less productive blacks. It should be noted here that the virulently anti-white Economic Freedom Fighters Party, helmed by Julius Malema, derives its funding from Jewish-Swazi billionaire Nathan Kirsh.

The music industry is, as with all forms of media, dominated by Jews, and its control has become increasingly centralized, another trend we’ve seen irrespective of the industry in question. In December 1998, with the PolyGram-Universal merger, the music industry’s Big Six became its Big Five, in control of 77.4% of a market estimated to be between $30 and $40 billion; 2004 saw another merger, this time of Sony and BMG, to create a Big Four. Coupled with the shrinking of independent labels, the Big Four were in control of a whopping 88% of the market by 2011. In December 2011, EMI was absorbed by the Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment, though in Europe regulators forced Universal Music to sell off its EMI assets which became the Parlophone Label Group, and was then promptly acquired by the third member of the Big Three, Warner Music Group. In 2012, the Big Three represented 88.6% of the market.

A snapshot of the leadership of the Big Three proves illustrative; this overview from December 2019 reveals an obscene overrepresentation of Jews including Michael Lynton, Chairman of the Board for the Warner Music Group and its Vice Chairman, Len Blavatnik; of the nine other members of the Board, Noreena Hertz, Ynon Kreiz, Thomas H. Lee, and Alex Blavatnik (Len’s brother) are Jewish. Mathias Dopfner is a Gentile, but is also a self-described “non-Jewish Zionist.” The rest, such as Stephen F. Cooper—also the CEO, replacing the Jewish Edgar Bronfman, Jr.—are either contested or I could not definitively find out. Co-Chair and CEO of Warner Records, Aaron Bay-Schuck, has Jewish ancestry, and other prominent Jews in management include the COO of subsidiary Atlantic Records Group Julie Greenwald and its CEO Craig Kallman. Universal Music Group Chairman and CEO Lucian Grainge is Jewish, as are: Chairman and CEO of the Universal Music Publishing Group’s global publishing division, Jody Gerson; Chairman and CEO of Universal Music UK and Ireland, David Joseph; and Executive Vice President of Marketing Andrew Kronfeld. Sony Music CEO Rob Stringer is Jewish, as is its COO Kevin Kelleher, Executive Vice President and General Counsel Julie Swidler, and President of Global Digital Business and US Sales Dennis Kooker. In other words, all three major record labels are headed by Jews and their corporate governance is dominated by Jews as well. The rest, like RCA Records CEO Peter Edge, are “well-liked Gentiles.”

Just four conglomerates control 90% of the entire US media market today, which includes television, films, telecommunications, and more: Comcast (including NBCUniversal), Disney, ViacomCBS (controlled by National Amusements), and AT&amp;T (including WarnerMedia). These conglomerates are, in fact, almost entirely Jewish-controlled. Jews are overrepresented at places like CNN (a WarnerMedia subsidiary) by a factor of twenty-five and are over-represented among senior executive positions at the major television broadcast networks, cable networks, and movie production companies by a factor of 44.5!

Chapter 18: How to Get Rich

January 29, 2020

What is the value of a human life? In order to answer this question we must first assess the life in question. What did they do with their life? The sad truth is that most people don't do anything of a positive nature to this world. So let us now rephrase the question. What is the value of a wasted human life? The majority of people in this world waste their lives away. So the question is then generalised and then brought back to its original premise, what is the value of a human life?

I used to highly value all forms of life. But the more I learned about humans and their ways, the more disgusted I became. Humans are not worthy of your time. The majority are evil and will hurt your God-given mission. These lives are a cancer on our species. The original question is nonsensical because they not only add no value to our collective evolution but actually subtract from it. They are not only worthless but end up costing us a great deal to the collective health of our human civilisation. These lives not only don't deserve what commodities they have been blessed with but also don't deserve the breath God has gifted them. They are useless eaters that keep our world in the past instead of looking towards the future. They destroy the works of God and they live lives of depression pulling everybody else in around them. A human life like the one I describe is a cancer to our society and we need to figure out ways to remove them from our presence. For having them as our neighbours not only hurts the collective evolution of our society but also the personal development of the individual.

Can people change? I am not saying that it is not possible for one who is evil to become good. But I have never seen it. We live by our nature and if our nature in which we built in childhood is evil, then we will stick to the ways of evil. How can someone become good when all they know is bad? Maybe there are few cases in this world where an evil person truly turned over a new leaf, but such occurrences are not at all common. This is why people should be judged based upon the actions in which they have already committed. Not actions that they may or may not commit. It is a fruitless endeavour to attempt to convert an evil person. I have tried this my entire life. Do not focus on those who are evil in this world. They had their chance and they failed. Instead, focus on those who are good. Avoid those who are mediocre, for they are just as harmful to your personal development as those who are evil. Those who enjoy making insulting comments on works of virtue in which they haven't read is an activity enjoyed by both those who are evil and those who are mediocre. Don't let them destroy your works through their unfounded insults. Don't work for God for fame. Instead work for God out of the conviction of your heart. It matters not if you make a video that still has no views after two years. God sees your toils. And it is your toils that will be judged, independent of whether or not humans accepted your information. If you tried your best in this life to save the world, then God will greatly reward you independent of whether or not your work made a significant impact on the world. For works of virtue are hidden in this world. God sees your heart. If your heart worked tirelessly in this life to bring about the kingdom of heaven, then God will reward your toils whether or not the world accepted your information into mainstream society.

Do not value human life that destroys human life. All human lives are not valuable. Most actually do damage to the cause of collective enlightenment. Collective mentality controls people. These individuals are not worth your time. They have already irreversibly destroyed any chance they have at obtaining heaven. For one must be fit for heaven to enter. How fit are you to enter heaven? Was your life spent helping other people or was it spent focused on yourself? After our deaths, our soul travels to the place it is most suitable for. If you live a wicked selfish life then your soul will join others who also lived a wicked and selfish life. If you were one of the few who lived a life of compassion, then your soul will return to others who have done the same. We create our heaven or hell through the actions in which we take in life. Where do you want to go? Do you want to spend out your eternity with other wicked people or do you want to spend it with those who are kind and compassionate? There is justice in our universe despite it not existing within our world. We will all be held responsible for the consequences of our actions. There is no escaping from the actions in which we took in this life.

Those who are most important in this world are not those who save lives. God will take people when it is their time and there is nothing that we can do about that. And the majority of people on this world are evil. How good would it look on Judgement Day for saving a lot of evil people? For the true liberators of the world are those who invest their entire lives in causes of compassion. Anyone can get a paid job as an ambulance driver. It takes real character to truly give your life over to the public. Value life insomuch as what is in your capabilities to save. But worry much more about saving the soul than saving the body. For a body will die in time whether or not it is saved. But a soul last forever and as a result it is a much more commendable life spent attempting to save others souls. Just because the worldly reward for saving a life is praise and the worldly reward for saving a soul is nothing does not mean that saving a soul is not important. Do not work for worldly rewards but instead heavenly ones. The true hero is not one who saves a life but instead one who saves a soul. For its consequences are infinitely more severe. Give your life over to the process of showing people the way to enlightenment. But before you can do that, you must first obtain enlightenment. You can't teach something in which you know not.

This world is structured so that only the social elite can succeed. Those who are not rich have no ability to truly progress in this world. Stars are created by the rich, not by the talents in which individuals hold. Investors invest in the rich and leave the poor without the ability to perform what tasks they were meant to in life. It is impossible to get on top without destroying all those who stand in your way. The system is structured to reward those who use unscrupulous methods to achieve their goals and punish those who live by a code. The social elite choose what is popular and what is not. However, obtaining such positions of power does not come without its consequences. For they have lost their soul. Their investors require certain behaviours from them and if they do not comply then they will lose their funding and as a result, their fame. I can say anything that I want because I have nobody over me telling me what I can and cannot do. As a result, I am free to be as controversial as I want. But such freedom results me in obtaining no investors which means that I cannot advertise effectively. This means that me and my work are hidden from the world. My website doesn't even show up in a search even if you type in the exact wording within it. My videos won't even show up even if you type the exact wording in it. Other results rank higher than mine that are completely irrelevant to the topic searched for for. The rich intentionally make it so the poor cannot succeed in life. The rich view the poor as their slaves. Because if they were able to succeed in life then that demeans their own life. So they literally place fail-safes in the technology to stop the poor from succeeding. For the rich need the poor working mundane jobs constantly in order to keep their position at the top. Currently, the richest 1% own more than twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people. In 2017, there were 7.53 billion people on this planet. Does this seem fair to you? Do the math. And they want to hire you to make them richer and keep you at the bottom.

Those who are spiritually dead are in truth not alive. And there is no caring about those who have already passed, for their home now is above or below depending on the actions in which they took in life. Those who have no ability to see spiritual value destroy the works of God. Do not sympathise with these people. However, my problem lies with the ""good"" person who watches evil unfold and does nothing to stop it. How can one call themselves ""good"" if they allow evil to prevail? They can't. Those who watch evil unfold without doing anything about it are just as bad as those who are committing the evil. This accounts for the majority of the population of our world. Hell will be chockablock full while heaven extremely spacious. It is like comparing a city to a rural town. It is only few who will enter the kingdom of heaven. And the only other option is Hell: for their is no middle. For those who were pure evil are just as evil as those who did nothing to prevent it. As a result, the mediocre will share the same residence as those who spent their lives immersed in devilish deeds.

""I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm - neither hot nor cold - I am about to spit you out of my mouth. You say, 'I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.' But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.""
Revelation 3:15-17

Those who love this world will also suffer the consequences of the actions that secular society has taken. Those who align themselves with the bad guys will suffer the same fate as the bad guys independent of whether or not they took those bad actions. For their bad actions was inaction in a time of need. For inaction is in itself an action. Do you want to know how to get rich? Redefine the term rich. For I am the richest person in the world. I possess enlightenment which is more valuable than all of the gold in the world. I am secure in where I am going after my death and as a result, I do not fear death. My riches are my works and my security in my afterlife. I have all that I need in this world because I have God and God gives me everything that I could ever desire. But God discourages greed and as a result, all of my extra income is spent on good causes instead of saving to obtain interest. I live a better life than any rich person lives and I live on a meager pension. What are riches to you? Rich people are not happy. Money cannot buy happiness. Financial freedom is entrusting all of your money to God even if this causes you to be homeless. True happiness comes from God and nothing on this world. Money can't make you happy. People can't make you happy. The only happiness a secular person can experience are fleeting pleasures that come and go like the wind. Because according to them nothing exists but what they can see. But nothing they can see will ever bring joy to their life. As a result, they live out terrible lives exploiting others because they truly think that there will be no consequences for their actions in the afterlife. The afterlife could care less whether or not you believe in it. After your death you will either awake to heaven or hell. While being tortured for eternity you are welcome to complain and say that you did not believe in the afterlife and as a result this shouldn't be happening to you. It matters not what you believe. The truth is the truth independent of whether or not you believe it. What you believe has absolutely no bearing on the truth.

Those who are rich are those who are rich in spirit. And for those who are rich in spirit it is also easy to identify others who are rich in spirit. God gives His warriors the powers of discernment and as a result they can easily see who is with them and who is against them. No one can ever trick me. I see through those who come to me with ulterior motives. To be rich is to be blessed with the vision from God. Those who truly dedicate their lives to God are given an alternative vision. God removes their nearsightedness and allows their vision to stretch not only all the way around the world but also into the heavens. To be rich is to have security in your afterlife. To be rich is to create a character in which it is impossible to sin with. I never do wrong. I always do right. I am constantly placed in situations that test my moral compass. And I always pass the test. I don't even have to worry about the tests. My actions always reflect my character. Those who commit bad actions have a weak character. Even if someone ""slips up"", this still reflects their character. If it is possible for you to sin then you are not saved. For salvation actually entails being saved from your sins. And being saved from your sins does not entail continuing to sin. If you want to stop sin once and for all, truly give your entire life to God. But listen to the words I am saying literally. Giving your life to God means that it is no longer yours and that will reflect in your actions. All these Christians getting ""saved"" is a big sham. They are merely going through a ritualistic process that attempts to redeem them from their sins. But it fails because they do not truly live their lives for God. Instead, they live their lives for themselves and try to go to church one day a week. Does a few hours a week sound like giving your life to God? Nay, they know not what they do. For there is no get out of jail free card in this game. We will all be held responsible for our actions.

To be rich is to give your life to God. To bask in that richness is to take actions on a daily basis that helps save our world. But in order to take those actions you need to know what and who you are saving the world from. The days of claiming you are something that you are not are over. For we can easily examine your works to assess your character. There are no Christians, no Jews, and no Muslims. For religions have been corrupted by identifying within them instead of learning their content. Religions are the ways of the old and spirituality the ways of the future. This mindset isolates me quite significantly because almost all who believe in God believe in a religion. This means that I am one man against the entire world. And here is the benefit of my riches: I win no matter what I do. Because I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am right. Because God has gifted me with spiritual powers that see everything clearly. In addition, I am possessed by Satan. The time for the Antichrist is coming. My time is coming. Now watch the world end. The time is nigh.

Tommy Wiseau was a man who seemingly came out of nowhere. He had a bunch of money, that noone still knows where he got it(selling fur coats according to Wiseau), and he made the 2003 best worst movie known as The Room. Not only was he the Director, the writer, and producer... but the lead actor. Sound familiar?

Comparing the two, they seem to be cut from the same cloth; low budget, bad writing, terrible acting, weird music(the main titles are eerily similar). I'm sure you could say the same with a lot of movies... but let's look closer; both films have a blonde love interest who is promiscuous. A leading man who shows off his bare ass. An overbearing mother says really awkward things. Again, you could see these character tropes in other films... but Wiseau has stated he had the idea/script for The Room in development for several years.

I propose that Tommy Wiseau was responsible for both projects. You don't just walk in off the street with millions of dollars and proceed to direct, write, produce, and star in your own film. No indie films prior? No filmmaker experience? No connections in Hollywood? Nothing. Wiseau is a very mysterious person... many aspects of who is and where he came from remain a mystery. 

I believe that Wiseau had SOME form of experience prior to The Room. Perhaps a terrible 3DO game? Perhaps he made him money from severance pay after being fired for making said game or selling his company? Plumbers came out in 94...

486,Ascetic_Ideal,evivyy,"In a way this post contains two distinct conspiracy theories, that I suspect may be linked together, hence my post.

A few years ago, I attended a private government research conference where Dr. George Church, Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and Professor of Health Sciences and Technology at Harvard and MIT, was describing how his lab systematically altered the genome of a bacterial cell using synthetic biology and genetic engineering to make cells resistant to viruses. There was some brief discussion of how these techniques could be used for the opposite purpose. Immediately following Dr. Church’s presentation, other researchers and myself had a discussion afterwards about how frightening these technological capabilities were. Over the years, this concern has always remained in the back of my mind and I’ve discussed it with others that didn’t attend the talk on various occasions. It is worth noting that a lot of George Church’s recent research also involves viruses, specifically adeno-associated viruses (AAV) (keep this in mind, it will be important later). Most recently in his career, Dr. Church has been funded by DARPA and IARPA, with the most recently funded grant titled, ‘Functional Genomic and Computational Assessment of Threats’ (by IARPA). 

The description of this grant solicitation, if you search for it, starts with:

“The biological sciences have experienced extraordinary growth over the past decade. Technological advances in DNA synthesis, sequencing, large gene construction, and data analysis are expanding biological research and the bioeconomy, and are likely to enable revolutionary advances in medicine, agriculture, and materials. At the same time, these advances have intensified security concerns around the accidental or deliberate misuse of biotechnologies. One special concern regards DNA synthesis technologies that can be used to create novel organisms.”

Hence, Dr. Church is obviously involved in the area of applying advanced techniques (lab based and computational) to engineer organisms to make them resistant to viruses (and potentially vice-versa, to engineer viruses), and is involved in the efforts to combat the risks involved.

Interestingly enough, Dr. Church was one of the scientists most involved with Jeffrey Epstein. He received funding from Epstein for the purposes of ‘cutting edge science &amp; education’ from 2005 to 2007 (the funding was apparently unrestricted). Epstein was convicted of soliciting an underage prostitute in 2008. Following his conviction, Dr. Church and Epstein continued to meet.  According to an NBC report, ""he had six phone calls and meetings with Epstein in 2014, as shown in Church’s online calendar (he has posted one every year since 1999). Sample entry: “Jun 21, 2014 Lunch w/ Jeffrey Epstein, 12-1:30, Martin Nowak’s Institute.” (Nowak, a Harvard biologist/mathematician, is also a Brockman client and Edge participant.) He also met with Epstein “several times” each year since, Church said.""

These meetings were often between Church, Epstein, and Church’s colleague Dr. Martin Nowak, Harvard Professor of Biology and Mathematics and Director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. At the get-togethers with Nowak, Church said, “Epstein seemed interested in the science of life’s origins and mathematically modeling the evolution of viruses” (among other things). Epstein had also previously given a whopping $6.5 million dollars in research money to Dr. Nowak’s lab at Harvard in 2003. Apparently, Epstein had actually pledged a total of $30 million dollars (which is an incredible amount of money for a university professor to receive for research; large government funded grants usually top out at $2-3 million over several years) to Dr. Nowak’s program (Harvard claims it never received the full $30 million however). I was not able to find additional information on what these talks in 2014 and beyond ultimately led to, or if more money was pledged to or received by these prominent scientific figures. Another thing to add is that Nowak also has a record of studying and writing about viruses, such as his first book publication in 2000 titled, Virus Dynamics: Mathematical Principles of Immunology and Virology.

Jumping to a slightly different topic of discussion. There are other two other posts that stood out to me in this sub. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ev7az3/wuhan_coronovirus_bioweapon_conspiracy_indepth/

This post describes a few things. First, Wuhan, China, the 7th most populated city in a country with 1.4 billion has a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory that was recently established in 2015. It is apparently one out of 70 or so in the entire world (number was given by OP of the post linked above; my own search only turned up 52), and it is the only BLS-4 lab in the ENTIRE country of China. For those unfamiliar with what BLS-4 refers to, they are labs involving the study of the greatest biological threats and have the highest level of biosafety precautions. It is the sort of lab where researchers would attempt to study and perhaps modify something like a coronavirus. As the other redditor pointed out (and is also outlined in other r/conspiracy posts), there are lead scientists, such as Xing-Ye Ge, that study coronaviruses based out of Wuhan. These studies are often carried out by a team of 5-20 researchers, usually across institutions.

https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Xing-Yi-Ge/5583604?sort=influence

If you look up the Wuhan scientists research profile, you’ll be able to find that this individual and his fellow researchers also publish studies on adenoviruses in bats (similar to Dr. Church’s own virus-focused work on adeno-associated viruses, which are similar to adenoviruses and have similar applications). Further searching indicates that adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses hold potential to serve as a vaccine for coronaviruses, and there are several studies on this. Dr. Church’s own work is tangentially related to this, as he studies adeno-associated viruses mostly in the context of delivering it as a sort of gene therapy. To be fair, however, these topics are outside my own area of expertise.

Now on to another recent reddit post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ev9adz/harvard_biologist_charles_lieber_taken_into/

In the last 24 hours, a colleague of Dr. Church and Dr. Nowak, Dr. Charles Lieber, Professor and Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University, was arrested and criminally charged over a contract he made with a foreign university. Where? In Wuhan, China. As a side note, it’s worth pointing out to those unaware that all three of these people are some of the highest-ranking academic officials at Harvard and are revolutionary scientists in their respective fields. They would not at all be considered minor or even moderately important figures at Harvard. 

According to the Justice Department: ""Lieber, 60, lied about his contact with the Chinese program known as the Thousand Talents Plan, which the U.S. has previously flagged as a serious intelligence concern. He also is accused of lying about about a lucrative contract he signed with China's Wuhan University of Technology.""

Apparently, amongst other things, Lieber established a secret research lab at the Wuhan university and was given $1.5 million dollars by the Chinese (in addition to salary and living expenses) to do so. Meanwhile “Lieber was also the principal investigator on at least six U.S. Defense Department research grants, with a cumulative value of more than $8 million, according to the affidavit. It also says he was the principal investigator on more than $10 million in grants funded by the National Institutes of Health.” So, Dept. of Defense… NIH…

For those that are unfamiliar with academia, you may be wondering “how often does a leading, well-funded academic scientist from the most prestigious university in the country set up a secret lab with a foreign government?” No, this doesn’t typically happen, and it is extraordinarily – and I mean extraordinarily – odd and suspicious. Researchers are sometimes solicited by foreign governments and will leaf or share info, but set up another lab somewhere else under the radar? Maybe a minor scientist would, but a major one? I’ve never heard of such a thing. Some other redditor mentioned that Lieber’s research seems to be mostly unrelated to bioweapons research, and this is true. Most oddly though, if you try to search Charles Lieber’s Google Scholar page (basically a page where you can find all scientific articles and books authored by a researcher), his page just went dark. It shows up in the Google search results, but says ‘No information available for this page’. I kid you not, his Google Scholar page went down as I was writing this post. When you try to click on it, it strangely links you to the Google Scholar page of some completely different person.

In my mind, these are a series of very strange coincidences that seem to be interconnected. As the redditor of the first link I posted put it, what are the odds that the new coronavirus that is now making world news just so happened to come out of the same place that the Chinese just set up their first BLS-4 lab a few years ago that also just so happens to be a place where researchers are studying coronaviruses? What are the odds that, again, just in the last several hours, one of the most prominent scientists at Harvard was arrested for setting up a secret lab at Harvard University? Also, why was Jeffrey Epstein giving heaps and heaps of money to researchers at Harvard studying synthetic biology and genetic engineering, who had the means to systematically alter cells or viruses – people receiving money from secret defense agencies such as DARPA and IARPA – and stated himself he was interested in modeling the evolution of viruses.

We need to look into these things further. Even if the Epstein-Church-Nowak part of the conspiracy doesn’t link to the Lieber-Wuhan Coronavirus portion, these two segments stand well on their own and I feel that despite having more of a background in nanotech instead of bioweapons, Liebers arrest for secret lab in Wuhan while the coronavirus problem continues to explode is just too much of a coincidence.

 In the late 1700's revolutionists fought against the British kingdom pretty much because they were taxing colonizers  and the colonizers realized they didn't really care for that. They were being taxed for everything and it was for no reason other than to fund the British Kingdom. They coined the phrase ""No Taxation without Representation!"" a saying synonymous with the Gadsden flag.   


Today, almost 300 years later, our country is being ran by a government that taxes its citizens but doesn't represent the citizens when it comes time to spend the money we generate. We bailed out banks that destroyed our economy in 2008, corporations that fed its workers starving wages with no benefits and we did nothing to help the common man survive through it. Millions of people lost their jobs their homes their livelihood. We didn't get bailed out, we didn't get huge tax breaks but we definitely picked up the check when the govt' handed out those trillions of dollars.   


Now today we see people who wave the Gadsden flag around but are against taxation with representation the very thing that flag came to represent. "" why should I pay for someone elses healthcare "" is a common talking point by this bunch. It's ironic really because that's infact what private health insurance is. You along with thousands of others pay premiums and copays so the next person on your insurance providers plan goes to the doctor they can make it more affordable.   


Why is it now the people who wave the flag or have it hung up in their home somewhere or post pictures of it online are the ones who don't support what it represents ?   


I personally, before doing research about my own bias, thought that flag had some racist background because well, I only see the flag at rallies where you see neo nazis and confederates hanging out.   


After doing my research I come to realize I am echoing the same sentiment that the first marines of our country were saying almost 300 years ago, despite being told by certain president supporters saying I hate my country.  


 I support the ideology of those who first fought to protect our country from tyranny. No longer would we be slaves to the machine that is our oppressor the British Kingdom and now our own government and politicians have become the current oppressors. They have convinced us that we are not entitled to be healthy, we are not entitled to get paid a LIVABLE wage - As FDR said a livable wage does not mean just barely getting by with a roof with holes in it over your head, no no no, a LIVABLE wage means we can get by comfortably. We hear the talking points all the time, ""why should I have to pay for this persons healthcare - they should get a job and get off drugs by them selves "" or ""People working at McDonalds don't deserve $15 an hour!"" the problem with that type of logic is it misplaces blame onto the individuals who are working for the machine that is our current oppressive government. What ever happened to "" don't tread on me!? "" why don't we fight for taxation with representation together?   


If we all seem to agree democrats / republicans are just different sides of the same coin then why don't we form a new party that represents our best interests and understands a fellow US citizen is a brother / sister and we are currently all in this together ( Unless you are just stupid rich )  so its about time we acted like it.   


Stop the divisivness that makes it easier for us to fight with eachother when we all have the same basic needs and are entitled to these needs as citizens.

[**The False Front**](http://www.skybooksusa.com/time-travel/experime/thefalse.htm)  


Temporal anomalies are scattered throughout the world -- things that could not possibly belong to the time period in which they were found. Evidence exists of human civilization, artifacts and technology out of time that are abundant, well researched and well documented.  


This forbidden knowledge is being protected and hidden from all of us.

Today’s popular view of modern human presence in the distant past is a false front. The real truth is out there showing proof of advanced technology and people millions of years before humanity is stated to have evolved on the planet.

&gt;Why has the scientific establishment and government suppressed and ignored these remarkable finds?  
Where did they come from?  
How did they get there?  
Why are we suppressing this suggestive proof of modern time travelers visiting our past?

As you study the forbidden knowledge on these pages a whole new truth will emerge and become apparent to you... the truth that the earth was visited or inhabited by modern humans using advanced technology long before the appearance of the first humans as the history books write today.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/3rfb2lg1end41.gif

 

The chart above presents the accepted scientific view of evolution on this planet... It shows human beings appearing on the earth about 1.6 million years ago, and human civilization just 10,000 years ago.  


However, using accepted scientific methods numerous finds show conclusive proof of modern humans and advanced civilizations present or visiting the earth’s past long before this timeline represents as possible. The proof is shocking! Scientific proof of visitors, possibly time travelers, long before civilized man evolved on the planet.  


From where, or perhaps ""when,"" were advanced civilizations visiting our past thousands or millions of years before man appeared on the earth?

As we move further back in time through the different eras, you will see evidence continue to grow... evidence showing proof of modern humans and technology in the distant past.

[**Cenozoic Era Proof**](http://www.skybooksusa.com/time-travel/experime/cenozoic.htm)  


The *Cenozoic Era* is last of the five major eras of geologic time, beginning about 65 million years ago and extending through the present.

It follows the *Cretaceous* period of the *Mesozoic* era and is subdivided into the Tertiary period and the Quaternary period. Features of Tertiary times are considered in articles under the names of the various shorter time periods (epochs) making up the Tertiary period; in order, from earliest to latest, these are the *Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene,* and *Pliocene.*  


The accepted scientific view of evolution in the Cenozoic Era shows human beings appearing on the earth about 1.6 million years ago, and human civilization just 10,000 years ago.

Yet the scientific finds presented below present a very shocking and different story.  
 

 

**Pleistocene Epoch Finds**

\- Copper Coin from Illinois, over 200,000 years old  
This rendition of a *coin-like object*, from a well boring near *Lawn Ridge*, *Illinois*, was found at a depth of about 114 feet below the surface.

According to the information supplied by the Illinois State Geological Survey, the deposits containing the coin are between 200,000 and 400,000 years old...

Who left this coin hundreds of thousands of years before civilized man evolved?  


&amp;#x200B;

\- **Modern Human Skeleton from Tanzania, over 800,000 years old**  
In 1913 Professor **Hans Reck**, of Berlin University, conducted investigations at *Olduvai Gorge* in *Tanzania*, then German East Africa.

During his stay at Olduvai Gorge, Reck found a modern human skeleton that remains a source of mystery and controversy to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

This modern skull is from a fully human skeleton found that year. The human skeletal remains, including this complete skull, were cemented in the rock and had to be chipped with hammers and chisels. It was found in the upper end of a rock bed dated at more than 1,000,000 years old.

How did this modern human find his way 1,000,000 years into the past?

**-** **Modern Human Skull in Buenos Aires, over 1,000,000 years old**  
In **1896**, workers excavating a dry dock in ***Buenos Aires*** found a modern human skull. The *Pre-Ensenadan stratum* in which the Buenos Aires skull was found is a least 1.0 - 1.5 million years old.

&amp;#x200B;

Even at 1 million years the presence of a fully modern human skull anywhere in the world is highly anomalous.

Why and how did a modern human *arrive in Buenos Aires over 1,000,000 years ahead of its time?*

**Pliocene Epoch Finds**

 

**-** **Figurines from Nampa, Idaho, about 2 million years old**  
A small human image, skillfully formed in clay, was found in 1889 at *Nampa*, *Idaho*.

The figurine came from the the 300-foot level of a well boring and dated to be of the Plio-Pleistocene age, about 2 million years old. **G. F. Wright** noted,

&gt;""The image is about an inch and a half long; and remarkable for the perfection with which it represents the human form... It was a female figure, and had the lifelike lineaments in the parts which were finished that would do credit to the classic centers of art.""

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;Upon showing the object to Professor F. W. Putnam,"" wrote Wright, ""he at once directed attention to the character of the incrustations of iron upon the surface as indicative of a relic of considerable antiquity. There were patches of anhydrous red oxide of iron in protected places upon it, such as could not have been formed upon any fraudulent object.""

Humans had not even evolved on this planet two million years ago. *So who created or left this artifact in earth’s distant past?*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 **-** **Modern Human Skull found in Italy, over 3 - 4 million years old**  
Late in the summer of 1860, Professor **Giuseppe Ragazzoni**, a geologist and teacher at the Technical Institute of Brescia, traveled to the nearby locale of *Castenedolo*, about 10 kilometers southeast of *Brescia*, to gather fossil shells in the Pliocene strata exposed in a pit at the base of a low hill, the *Colle de Vento*. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a1iazt2jend41.jpg?width=267&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15a7f5d559901691f6e53aab80144293c6a0afc5

&amp;#x200B;

 

Here he discovered this remarkable and anatomically modern human skull. The stratum from which it was taken is assigned to the *Astian stage of the Pliocene*.

According to modern authorities, the Astian belongs to the Middle Pliocene, which would give the skull an age of 3 - 4 million years.

*Why and how did this modern human visit* ***Italy*** *nearly two million years before human beings walked the planet?*  


&amp;#x200B;

**-** **Carved Shell from the Red Crag, England, between 2.0 and 2.5 million years old**  
In a report delivered to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1881, **H. Stopes**, *F.G.S.* (*Fellow of the Geological Society*), described a shell, the surface of which bore a carving of a crude but unmistakably human face. The carved shell was found in the stratified deposits of the Red Crag.

The *Red Crag*, part of which is called the *Walton Crag*, is dated to be of Late Pliocene age between 2.0 and 2.5 million years old. This find would place intelligent beings in England as far back as 2.0 million and maybe as much as 2.5 million years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

One should keep in mind that in terms of conventional paleoanthropoligical opinion, one does not encounter such works of art until the time of fully *modern Cro-Magnon man* in the Late Pleistocene, about 30,000 years ago.

*What visitor to Earth’s distant past carved and left this shell?*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Eocene Epoch Finds**  
 

&amp;#x200B;

**-** **Chalk Ball near Laon, France, 45 - 55 million years old**  
The April 1862 edition of *The Geologist* included an English translation of an intriguing report by **Maximilien Melleville**, the vice president of the *Societe Academique of Laon* , France.

This chalk ball was discovered in an Early Eocene lignite bed. On the basis of its stratigraphic position, is has been assigned a date of 45 - 55 million years ago.

According to Melleville, there was no possibility that the chalk ball was a forgery:

&gt;""It really is penetrated over four-fifths of its height by a *black bituminous color* that merges toward the top into a yellow circle, and which is evidently due to the contact of the lignite in which it had been for so long a time plunged. The upper part, which was in contact with the shell bed, on the contrary has preserved its natural color -- the dull white of the chalk.... As to the rock in which it was found, I can affirm that it is perfectly virgin, and presents no trace whatever of any ancient exploitation.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1c8targqend41.jpg?width=267&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a6810e8d7cf3c0bfa01279c26d0530ffc6eed3f

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;As extraordinary as it might seem to those attached to standard evolutionary views, the evidence associated in this find suggest that if humans made the ball, they must have been in France 45 - 55 million years ago.

*Who made and left this man made artifact in our past long before human evolution... even before grazing and carnivorous mammals walked the planet?*

&amp;#x200B;

 

**-** **Mortar and Pestle in California, up to 55 million years old**  
In 1877 Mr. **J. H. Neale** was superintendent of the *Montezuma Tunnel Company*, and ran the Montezuma tunnel into the gravel underlying the lava of *Table Mountain, Tuolumne County*...

At a distance of between 1400 and 1500 feet from the mouth of the tunnel, or of between 200 and 300 feet beyond the edge of the solid lava, Mr. Neale saw several spear-heads of some dark rock and nearly one foot in length.

On exploring further, he himself found a small mortar three or four inches in diameter and of irregular shape.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8bxtmdgtend41.jpg?width=171&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdeeaaa0460fe8ae3a67b973e1c1d38decda8d8d

&amp;#x200B;

 

This was discovered within a foot or two of the spear-heads.

He then found a large well-formed pestle and near by a large and very regular mortar. All of these relics were found the same afternoon, and were all within a few feet of one another and close to the bed-rock, perhaps within a foot of it. Mr. Neale declares that it is utterly impossible that these relics can have reached the position in which they were found excepting at the time the gravel was deposited, and before the lava cap formed.

The position of the artifacts in gravel close to the bed-rock at *Tuolumne Table Mountain* indicates they were 33-55 million years old. Grazing and carnivorous mammals had not even evolved on the planet at this time.

*So who brought and left behind these artifacts in California nearly 50 million years ago?*  
 

&amp;#x200B;

 **-** **Sling Stone from Bramford, England, 5 - 50 million years old**  
This sling stone is from the detritus bed beneath the Red Crag at *Bramford*, *England*. At least Pliocene in age, the stone is at least 5 million and possibly up to 50 million years old. Upon examination it was obvious that the stone had been shaped by the hand of man....

The whole surface... has been scraped with a flint, in such a way that it is covered with a series of facets running fairly regularly from end to end.... The scraping described above covers the whole surface of the object, and penetrates into its irregularities.

As it stands the object is entirely artificial... yet left in a time millions of years before humans had had even evolved on the Earth.

[**Mesozoic Era Proof**](http://www.skybooksusa.com/time-travel/experime/mesozoic.htm)  


The *Mesozoic Era* is one of the major divisions of geological history, following the Paleozoic era and preceding the Cenozoic era.

The Mesozoic era, which lasted from approximately 240 million to 65 million years ago, may be characterized as the Age of Reptiles because their greatest development occurred during this era. The first birds and mammals and the first flowering plants also appeared at this time. The Mesozoic era is divided into three time periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous.  


As we move back into time we enter a period in the *Mesozoic Era* that began with the first dinosaurs appearing on the earth and ending with the development of flowering plants. Humans wouldn’t evolve for at least another 136 million years.

Yet the scientific finds below suggest proof that advanced civilizations were visiting Earth’s past and walking at a time when dinosaurs roamed the planet.

 

**Cretaceous Period**  
 

**-** **Metallic Tube at Saint-Jean de Livet, France over 65 million years old**  
**Y. Druet** and **H. Salfati** announced in 1968 the discovery of semi-ovoid metallic tubes of identical shape but varying size in Cretaceous chalk.

The chalk bed, exposed in a quarry at *Saint-Jean de Livet*, *France*, is estimated to be least 65 million years old.

**Triassic Period**  
 

**-** **Shoe Sole from Nevada, dated at 213 - 248 million years ago**  
On October 8, 1922, the American Weekly section of the New York Sunday American ran a prominent feature titled ""*Mystery of the Petrified ’Shoe Sole*,"" by Dr. **W. H. Ballou**.

Ballou wrote:

&gt;""Some time ago, while he was prospecting for fossils in ***Nevada***, **John T. Reid**, a distinguished mining engineer and geologist, stopped suddenly and looked down in utter bewilderment and amazement at a rock near his feet. For there, a part of the rock itself, was what seemed to be a human footprint!  
   
Closer inspection showed that it was not a mark of a naked foot, but was, apparently, a shoe sole which had been turned into stone.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zui8gr22fnd41.jpg?width=267&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eee9271c95c70577d094e6d343745c36a5072908

 

&gt;The forepart was missing.  
   
But there was the outline of at least two-thirds of it, and around this outline ran a well-defined sewn thread which had, it appeared, attached the welt to the sole. Further on was another line of sewing, and in the center, where the foot would have rested had the object really been a shoe sole, there was an indentation, exactly such as would have been made by the bone of the heel rubbing upon and wearing down the material of which the sole had been made.

**Reid** got hold of a microphotographer and an analytical chemist of the *Rockefeller Institute*, who made photos and analyses of the specimen. The analyses removed any doubt of the shoe sole having been subjected to Triassic fossilization....

The microphoto magnifications are twenty times larger than the specimen itself, showing the minutest detail of thread twist and warp, proving conclusively that the shoe sole is not a resemblance, but is strictly the handiwork of man. Even to the naked eye the threads can be seen distinctly, along with the definitely symmetrical outlines of the shoe sole. Inside this rim and running parallel to it is a line which appears to be regularly perforated as if for stitches.

The Triassic rock bearing the fossil shoe sole is now recognized as being *dated at 213 - 248 million years old*. An obviously modern shoe, complete with stitching, and etched in time in ancient Triassic rock.

*What modern visitor was walking in our distant past more than 210 million years ago before the age of the dinosaurs?*  


[**Paleozoic Era Proof**](http://www.skybooksusa.com/time-travel/experime/paleozoi.htm)  


The ***Paleozoic Era*** is a major division of geological time, preceded by Precambrian time and followed by the Mesozoic era, and including the *Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous,* and *Permian* periods. The Paleozoic Era began about 570 million years ago and ended about 240 million years ago.  


As we move back even further in time we enter this period of the ***Paleozoic Era*** where life was evolving from primitive, multicellular, free-floating forms in the sea to advanced groups on land. The most advanced life forms at the end of this period where amphibians, insects, fern forests, and small reptiles. Humans would not evolve for nearly another 300 million years.

Yet the scientific finds below again suggest even more strongly that modern humans with advanced technology were visiting Earth’s past and walking at a time when the first life forms were just beginning to emerge on our planet.  
 

**Carboniferous Period**  
 

\- Gold Thread in England, between 320 - 360 million years old  
On June 22, 1844, this curious report appeared in the London Times:

&gt;""A few days ago, as some workmen were employed in quarrying a rock close to the Tweed about a quarter of a mile below Rutherford-mill, a ***gold thread*** was discovered embedded in the stone at a depth of eight feet.""

Dr. **A. W. Medd** of the British Geological Survey wrote in 1985 that this stone is of *Early Carboniferous* age between 320 and 360 million years old.

*Who dropped this gold thread in the ancient fern forests in a distant time when the most advanced life forms on the planet where amphibians and insects?*

 

\- Gold Chain from Morrisonville, Illinois, 260 - 320 million years old  
On June 11, 1891, *The Morrisonville Times* reported:

&gt;""A curious find was brought to light by Mrs. **S. W. Culp** last Tuesday morning. As she was breaking a lump of coal preparatory to putting it in the scuttle, she discovered, as the lump fell apart, embedded in a circular shape a small gold chain about ten inches in length of antique and quaint workmanship.  
   
At first Mrs. Culp thought the chain had been dropped accidentally in the coal, but as she undertook to lift the chain up, the idea of its having been recently dropped was at once made fallacious, for as the lump of coal broke it separated almost in the middle, and the circular position of the chain placed the two ends near to each other, and as the lump separated, the middle of the chain became loosened while each end remained fastened to the coal.  
&gt;  
&gt;The lump of coal from which this chain was taken is supposed to come from the ***Taylorville*** or ***Pana mines*** (southern ***Illinois***) and almost hushes one’s breath with mystery when it is thought for how many long ages the earth has been forming strata after strata which hid the golden links from view. The chain was an eight-carat gold and weighed eight penny-weights.""

The *Illinois State Geological Survey* has said the coal in which the gold chain was found is 260 - 320 million years old. This raises the possibility that culturally advanced human beings were present or visiting in North America during that time.

*How did this gold chain find itself left behind in Earth’s distant past more than a quarter of a billion years before humans had evolved?*  
 

\- Carved Stone near Webster, Iowa, 260 - 320 million years old  
The April 2,1897 edition of the *Daily News of Omaha*, Nebraska, carried an article titled ""*Carved Stone Buried in a Mine*,"" which described an object from a mine near ***Webster City, Iowa***.

The article stated:

&gt;""While mining coal today in the Lehigh coal mine, at a depth of 130 feet, one of the miners came upon a piece of rock which puzzles him and he was unable to account for its presence at the bottom of the coal mine. The stone is of a dark grey color and about two feet long, one foot wide and four inches in thickness.  
   
Over the surface of the stone, which is very hard, lines are drawn at angles forming perfect diamonds. The center of each diamond is a fairly good ***face of an old man*** having a peculiar indentation in the forehead that appears in each of the pictures, all of them being remarkably alike. Of the faces, all but two are looking to the right.

*Was this stone carved and left behind by a traveler from earth’s future?*  


\- Iron Cup from Oklahoma Coal Mine, 312 million years old  
On November 27, 1948 the following statement was made by **Frank J. Kenwood** in *Sulphur Springs*, ***Arkansas***.

&gt;""While I was working in the Municipal Electric Plant in Thomas, ***Oklahoma*** in 1912, I came upon a solid chunk of coal which was too large to use. I broke it with a sledge hammer. This iron pot fell from the center leaving the impression mould of the pot in the piece of coal.  
   
Jim Stall (an employee of the company) witnessed the breaking of the coal, and saw the pot fall out. I traced the source of the coal, and found that it came from the *Wilburton, Oklahoma, Mines*. According to Robert O. Fay of the *Oklahoma Geological Survey*, the Wilburton mine coal is about 312 million years old.

*What advanced civilization or visitor was creating or using iron pots in our past more than 300 million years ago?*  


\- Block Wall in an Oklahoma Mine, at least 286 million years old  
**W.W. McCormick** of Abilene, Texas, reported his grandfather’s account of a stone block wall that was found deep within a coal mine:

&gt;""In the year 1928, I, Atlas Almon Mathis, was working in coal mine No. 5., located two miles north of Heavener, Oklahoma. This was a shaft mine, and they told us it was two miles deep. The mine was so deep that they let us down into it on an elevator.... They pumped air down to us, it was so deep."" One evening, Mathis was blasting coal loose by explosives in ""room 24"" of this mine.  
   
""The next morning,"" said Mathis, ""there were several concrete blocks laying in the room. These blocks were 12-inch cubes and were so smooth and polished on the outside that all six sides could serve as mirrors. Yet they were full of gravel, because I chipped one of them open with my pick, and it was plain concrete inside.""  
   
Mathis added: ""As I started to timber the room up, it caved in; and I barely escaped. When I came back after the cave-in, a solid wall of these polished blocks was left exposed. About 100 to 150 yards farther down our air core, another miner struck this same wall, or one very similar.""

The coal in the mine was *Carboniferous*, which would mean the wall was at least 286 million years old. According to Mathis, the mining company officers immediately pulled the men out of the mine and forbade them to speak about what they had seen. Mathis said the *Wilburton miners* also told of finding ""a solid block of silver in the shape of a barrel... with the prints of the staves on it,"" in an area of coal dating between 280 and 320 million years ago.

*What advance civilization built this wall?... Why was the truth, as is so many of these cases protected and hidden?... What is the real truth about time travelers, modern humans, and modern technology in our past?*  
 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Hieroglyphics in Ohio Coal Mine, 260 million year old  
It is reported that **James Parsons**, and his two sons, exhumed a slate wall in a coal mine at *Hammondville*, ***Ohio***, in 1868. It was a large smooth wall, disclosed when a great mass of coal fell away from it, and on its surface, carved in bold relief, were several lines of hieroglyphics.

*Who carved these hieroglyphics more than 250 years before humans walked the earth?*  
 

**Devonian Period**  
 

\- Nail in Devonian Sandstone, between 360 and 408 million years old  
In 1844, Sir **David Brewster** reported that a nail had been discovered firmly embedded in a block of sandstone from the *Kingoodie* (*Mylnfield*) *Quarry* in *North Britain*. 

Dr. **A. W. Medd** of the British Geological Survey recently indicated that this sandstone is of ""*Lower Old Red Sandstone age*"" (Devonian, between 360 and 408 million years old). In his report to the *British Association for the Advancement of Science*, **Brewster** stated:

&gt;""The particular block in which the nail was found, was nine inches thick, and in proceeding to clear the rough rock for dressing, the point of the nail was found projecting about half an inch (quite eaten with rust) into the ’till,’ the rest of the nail lying along the surface of the stone to within an inch of the head, which went right down into the body of the stone.""

The fact that the head of the nail was buried in the sandstone block would seem to rule out the possibility the nail had been pounded into the block after it was quarried. This was a time where amphibians and insects were the only dominant life form on our planet.

*So who dropped this nail to have it eventually preserved in rock at a time more than 350 million years before humans appeared?*  
 

**Cambrian Period**  
 

\- Shoe Print in Utah Shale, 505 to 590 Million Years Old  
In 1968, **William J. Meister**, a draftsman and amateur trilobite collector, reported finding a shoe print in the Wheeler Shale near *Antelope Spring*, ***Utah***.

This *shoe-like indentation* and its cast were revealed when Meister split open a block of shale.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7mpd9n15fnd41.jpg?width=327&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08018f5c8a16b38ef8c188cb853b2a624a81b66b

 

Clearly visible within the imprint were the remains of trilobites, extinct marine arthropods. The shale holding the print and the trilobite fossils is from the *Cambrian*, and would thus be 505 to 590 million years old.

Meister described the ancient shoe-like impression in an article that appeared in the *Creation Research Society Quarterly:*

&gt;""The heel print was indented in the rock about an eighth of an inch more than the sole. The footprint was clearly that of the right foot because the sandal was well worn on the right side of the heel in the characteristic fashion.""

At this time in our planet’s history there was no plant or animal life on the land, even the most early types of fish swimming in the seas had not yet evolved. It must have been a very barren landscape that this visitor to Earth’s past saw as he walked the land.

*How did he arrive so far into our past?*  
 

 

**Pre-Cambrian Period**  
 

**-** **Metallic Vase from Pre-Cambrian Rock, over 600 Million Years Old**  
The following report, titled ""*A Relic of a Bygone Age*,"" appeared in the magazine Scientific American (June 5, 1852):

&gt;""A few days ago a powerful blast was made in the rock at *Meeting House Hill*, in ***Dorchester***, a few rods south of **Rev. Mr. Hall**’s meeting house. The blast threw out an immense mass of rock, some of the pieces weighing several tons, and scattered fragments in all directions. Among them was picked a metallic vessel in two parts, rent asunder by the explosion. On putting the parts together it formed a *bell-shaped vessel*, 4-1/2 inches high, 6-1/2 inches at the base, 2-1/2 inches at the top, and about an eighth of an inch in thickness.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hoj9eba7fnd41.jpg?width=164&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1797ed7a8e2b3f57bad78915b862722b0819ad1a

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;The body of this vessel resembles zinc in color, or a composition metal, in which there is a considerable portion of silver. On the side there are six figures of a flower, or bouquet, beautifully inlaid with pure silver, and around the lower part of the vessel a vine, or wreath, also inlaid with silver.  
   
The chasing, carving, and inlaying are exquisitely done by the art of some cunning workman. This curious and unknown vessel was blown out of the solid pudding stone, fifteen feet below the surface.""

According to a recent U.S. Geological Survey map of the Boston-Dorchester area, the pudding stone, now called the *Roxbury conglomerate*, is of Precambrian age, over 600 million years old. By standard accounts, life was just beginning to form on this planet during the Precambrian.

But in ***the Dorchester vessel*** we have evidence indicating the presence of artistic metal workers in North America over 600 million years before **Leif Erikson**. At this time in our planets history the was no life on land, plant or animal. The most advance life-form at this barren time in our planets history was simple algae floating in the seas. Yet somehow through time this beautiful work or art was brought and left behind and eventually buried and preserved in ancient rock.

*Did a time traveler from the earths future leave this behind in the hopes of later discovery... in an attempt to help ensure that the truth about time travel would one day be revealed?*

**-** **Grooved Sphere from South Africa, 2.8 Billion Years Old**  
Over the past several decades, *South African miners* have found hundreds of metallic spheres, at least one of which has three parallel grooves running around its equator.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ki1es6uafnd41.jpg?width=261&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0235bd2d43279b70961451543e7f32add3ecc93

 

The spheres are of two types

&gt;""one of solid bluish metal with white flecks, and another which is a hollow ball filled with a white spongy center.""

**Roelf Marx**, curator of the museum of *Klerksdorp*, ***South Africa***, where some of the spheres are housed, said:

&gt;""The spheres are a complete mystery. They look man-made, yet at the time in Earth’s history when they came to rest in this rock no intelligent life existed. The globes are found in *pyrophyllite*, which is mined near the little town of *Ottosdal* in the ***Western Transvaal***. This pyrophyllite is a quite soft secondary mineral with a count of only 3 on the Mohs’ scale and was formed by sedimentation about 2.8 billion years ago. On the other hand the globes are very hard and cannot be scratched, even by steel.""

The sphere with the three parallel grooves around it are too perfect to be anything but man made. The Precambrian mineral deposit where the globes are found is dated to be at least 2.8 billion years old. At this time simple microscopic cells were all that was alive on the earth.

But this is obviously not true.

Who created or left behind these magnificent spheres. Obviously man made, and stronger than steel, what was their purpose for the people who visited and left them behind in time?  


[**Other Finds**](http://www.skybooksusa.com/time-travel/experime/other.htm)  
 

**-** **Artifacts From AIX En Provence, France**  
In his book *Mineralogy*, **Count Bournon** recorded an intriguing discovery that had been made by French workmen in the latter part of the eighteenth century.

Bournon wrote:

&gt;""During the years 1786, 1787, and 1788, they were occupied near *AIX en Provence*, in ***France***, in quarrying stone for the rebuilding , upon a vast scale, of the Palace of Justice. The stone was a limestone of deep grey, and of that kind which are tender when they come out of the quarry, but harden by exposure to the air.  
   
The strata were separated from one another by a bed of sand mixed with clay, more or less calcareous. The first which were wrought presented no appearance of any foreign bodies, but, after the workmen had removed the ten first beds, they were astonished, when taking away the eleventh, to find its inferior surface, at the depth of forty or fifty feet, covered with shells.  
   
The stone of this bed having been removed, as they were taking away a stratum of argillaceous sand, which separated the eleventh bed from the twelfth, they found stumps of columns and fragments of stone half wrought, and the stone was exactly similar to that of the quarry: they found moreover coins, handles of hammers, and other tools or fragments of tools in wood.  
   
But that which principally commanded their attention, was a board about one inch thick and seven or eight feet long; it was broken into many pieces, of which none were missing, and it was possible to join them again one to another, and to restore to the board or plate its original form, which was that of the boards of the same kind used by the masons and quarry men: it was worn in the same manner, rounded and waving upon the edges.""

**Count Bournon**, continuing his description, stated:

&gt;""The stones which were completely or partly wrought, had not at all changed in their nature, but the ***fragments of the board***, and ***the instruments***, and pieces of instruments of wood, had been changed into ***agate***, which was very fine and agreeably colored. Here then, we have the traces of a work executed by the hand of man, placed at a depth of fifty feet, and covered with eleven beds of compact limestone: everything tended to prove that this work had been executed upon the spot where the traces existed.

*The presence of man had then preceded the formation of this stone.*  
 

\- Letter-like Shapes in Marble, Philadelphia  
In 1830, letter-like shapes were discovered within a solid block of marble from a quarry 12 miles northwest of ***Philadelphia***. The marble block was taken from a depth of 60-70 feet.

&amp;#x200B;

 

This was reported in the American Journal of Science (vol. 19, 1831, p. 361). The quarry workers removed layers of gneiss, mica slate, [hornblende](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornblende), talcose slate, and primitive clay slate before coming to the layer from which the block containing the letter-like shapes were cut.

While they were sawing through the block, the workmen happened to notice a rectangular indentation, about 1.5 inches wide by .625 inches high, displaying two ***raised characters***.

Several respectable gentlemen from nearby *Norristown*, ***Pennsylvania***, were called to the scene and inspected the object. It is hard to explain the formation of the characters as products of natural physical processes.

*This suggests the characters were made by intelligent humans in the distant past.*",conspiracy,Forbidden Knowledge Mega Thread  pictures  illustrations

The completion of the city is comparable to digging out a system of below ground chambers inhabitable for 20,000 people with just a hammer and chisel. It is suspected the city was used as a huge bunker to protect its occupants from possible natural disaster or war.

Amazingly, the community had accessible fresh water, shops, individual rooms, community rooms, tombs, escape routes, arsenals, livestock, and even a school sporting a study room.

A prehistoric, below grown, three-level, stone monument on the island of Malta is known as the [Hypogeum of Hal-Saflieni](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/arqueologia/esp_malta02.htm) and was uncovered in 1902.

Finding it was an accident: several laborers fell through a hole they were digging.

In addition, 7,000 skeletal remains were discovered. Unbeknownst to anyone is the time period Hypogeum of Hal-Saflieni was built, but it is made completely from megalithic stones.

To make matters even more strange, voices in the range 95 to 120 Hz can echo throughout the whole complex when a person is standing in a certain spot.

Essentially this means that women's voices often don't produce this effect in the same way that men's voices do.

If that's not strange enough, a man with a voice range at about 110 Hz, the whole dwelling becomes a room that induces trance-like states and appears to be able to stimulate the creative center of the human brain.

Around 2,000 feet long, the [Great Dam of Marib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marib_Dam) was almost twice as long as the Hoover Dam.

In about 600 A.D, the dam collapsed and burst, ruining most of the agriculture system and turning the area into the sandy spot it can be seen as today.

**Introduction**

For many years there have been reports and rumors of a vast network of underground complexes and tunnels beneath the North American continent. Starting in the late 1980s, the American government has tried to deflect these rumors through a campaign of misdirection and misinformation. Disclosure of the [Greenbrier Congressional Shelter](http://www.bvalphaserver.com/ftopicp-480224.html) at White Sulphur Springs is a good example of this campaign.

To believe the existence of the Greenbrier complex was revealed against the wishes of the American government is the height of naiveté. This revelation was allowed to take place. The Greenbrier underground complex was no longer useful, so it was sacrificed to divert attention away from a much larger secret. In other words, a classic misdirection ploy.  


While I do not have complete knowledge concerning the extent of America's covert underground infrastructure, I do have detailed first hand experience with many sites near my home in Oregon. Based on my experiences, and assuming a roughly uniform distribution correlated with U.S. population demographics, the total number of covert underground facilities is in the tens of thousands.  


What follows is both a compendium of my observations, and a do-it-your-self field guide for those who wish discover the true extent of the American covert underground infrastructure.  


**Rabbit holes**

The covert underground infrastructure serves many functions. Among these are strategic storage of materials and weapons, clandestine research and production facilities, alternant basing for military personnel and equipment, surface environment control systems (atmospheric lensing, synthetic earthquakes, weather modification, civilian population control, etc.), and of course sheltering essential government personnel during time of national crisis or war. This list is not complete, it is only indicative of the diverse ways in which the underground infrastructure is utilized.  


It should be obvious that many of the uses listed above require both support from, and easy access to, the surrounding surface communities. I call these underground access points ""rabbit holes"", and they represent a key detectable feature of the underground infrastructure.  


It should also be obvious that many of these uses require the facilities to be interconnected by a network of tunnels. The construction of these tunnels creates surface evidence of their existence, albeit transitory.

From the perspective of detection, the transitory nature of the evidence makes tunnel construction less useful than covert underground access points, however as we shall see, the evidence itself is far more compelling.  


**Searching for Alice**

As previously mentioned, many underground infrastructure functions require surface access, furthermore many underground facilities also make use of above ground support such as electrical utilities, generally as backup for their primary supply source. These requirements pose a design dilemma. The underground access points must be well hidden, and at the same time, easily accessible to personnel and/or vehicular traffic. What is true of covert underground access points, is also true to a lesser extent for utility supply points.  


How do you hide traffic and personnel movement? By mixing it with a legitimate flow of people and vehicles, in locations already under government ownership or control. In rural areas, public parks and recreational facilities make ideal locations. For instance, at a public camp ground, who will notice if 20 cars go in, but only 15 come out? In urban areas, post offices and other purpose built government installations are used.

After all, who pays attention to the comings and goings at a post office? In other words, the underground access points are hidden in plain sight. This is both a strength and a weakness. It is a strength if nobody is paying close attention, however it is also tremendous weakness, since anyone wishing to observe the location will blend in to the general ebb and flow of activity. In some respects, rural underground access points are easier to locate, but more dangerous to investigate, since the level of human activity will be less.  


Another aspect of *rabbit hole location* is proximity to some useful above ground resource. For instance, a public zoo makes a good source of genetic material for a bio-lab facility. It should be obvious that a major metropolitan hospital would make an ideal source for human genetic material, as well as the perfect location to ""field test"" some new weapon-ized bacteria or virus. What is true of urban access points, is also true for rural access points.

Many are located near the periphery of major urban populations. A large water reservoir, or a public camp ground located near a major highway, are good examples of useful above ground resources. Rural underground access points are favored as utility supply points, since the supply is less likely to be interrupted in time of national crisis.

As we shall see, this last observation can be used to great advantage in detecting rabbit hole locations.  


**Urban rabbit hole detection**

The detection of urban access points requires both persistence, and a certain amount of luck. Quite often, it will be some apparently trivial detail that will be your first clue.

The following is a list of indicators that are cause for suspicion:

1. A post office parking lot full of cars, with only one or two people visible inside the post office.
2. Sporadic late night activity at a government office building.
3. Security that is out of proportion with presumed facility use.
4. Unbalanced traffic patterns. Example: people or vehicles go in but do not come out, or visa versa.
5. Facility size is out of proportion to traffic flow. Example: many delivery vehicles at a small government office building.
6. Utility services is out of proportion to facility size. Example: large electrical service supplying a small government office building.
7. Deliveries are mismatched to presumed facility use. Example: 40 foot refrigerated truck, or medical supply truck unloading at social security office.
8. Facility location is inappropriate for presumed use or function. Example: social security office located in an industrial district.
9. Facility construction and/or layout is inappropriate for presumed use. Example: office building with oversized warehouse style loading dock.
10. Facility staff size and/or type is inappropriate for presumed facility use or function. Example: large ratio of managerial personnel (business suites) to clerical personnel.

The above list is far from exhaustive. R

ather, the list is intended to illustrate what sort of details should be examined to *uncover a rabbit hole*. As can be seen from the list, many clues involve some activity that does not match the presumed use or function of the facility. Other clues involve a mismatch between the physical nature of the facility and it's presumed function.  


Once a suspected rabbit hole has been located, further observation is required to develop a profile of anomalous activity. Drive by the location at different times of the day and night. Keep detailed records of observations. Enlist the help of individuals who live within sight of the facility to monitor activity.

Does a medical supply truck show up every Tuesday at a social security office? Is there any discernable pattern to the traffic flow imbalance?

It is the details that will ultimately confirm the existence of a suspected rabbit hole.  


**Rural rabbit hole detection**

As with urban access points, it will be a mismatch between activity and/or the physical nature of a facility, and it's presumed use or function that will indicate the presence of a rural underground access point. In addition, there are several aspects of rural underground access points that appear to be unique.

Most rural underground access points employ a form of radiated electro-magnet field that functions as a wide area deterrent to birds, rodents, and insects. The purpose of the field being to act as a contamination shield or barrier for the underground access point entrance. Next, since rural underground access points receive less intense public scrutiny, their supporting above ground infrastructure is generally speaking, more blatant.

The presence of a well maintained home with around the clock human supervision of the suspected facility is common feature. These homes will have multiple satellite dishes, and/or radio antennas. Another common feature of rural rabbit holes is the presence of odd alpha-numeric markings on the reverse side of highway traffic signs located near the underground access point.  


The following is a list of rural underground access point indicators.

&amp;#x200B;

1. A well maintained branch road leading to a little used park or recreational facility.
2. Electrical power lines that are routed near facility, when such routing results in longer line length and/or routing over a natural obstacle (mountain, river, etc.).
3. Electrical power lines or substations much larger than visible local load requirements.
4. Large reservoirs that serve no apparent useful function. Example: not needed for flood control or civilian water supply, or that have larger capacity than is required for presumed function.
5. The presence of truck traffic on rural roads with no known destination, or inappropriate truck types for apparent destination.
6. A public park or recreational facility that is maintained at a level well in excess of other nearby facilities, especially if facility less well known or used than other nearby facilities.
7. Public facility personnel (park rangers, etc.) that are overly nosey and/or suspicious of your activities, especially if personnel occupy the site on a 24/7 basis.
8. Public park or recreational facility where part of facility is fenced off, or accessed by a gated road, or otherwise made inaccessible to the general public.
9. The presence of inappropriate or unusual structures and/or construction methods. Examples: small cinder block building with an electrical power feed normally used on major office buildings. An unmarked, but well maintained trail in public park. An old building (possibly abandoned) with a new door, and expensive lock.
10. People at camp grounds that seem out of place. Example: improperly dressed, or using inappropriate equipment, or having unusual accents (these are people taking a recreational break from underground facilities).
11. Well maintained roads that are not shown on maps, or follow a different route than shown on maps.
12. A noticeable lack of wildlife (birds, small animals, insects, etc.) in a location that would normally support a large wildlife population (see 1.2.4 preface).
13. Any of the applicable indicators listed under urban rabbit hole detection. Example: unbalanced traffic flows, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As with urban rabbit hole detection, this list is far from complete. It is intended to illustrate what sort of indicators to look for, when searching for rural underground access points. Again, all of the techniques employed in urban rabbit hole discovery are applicable to rural underground access points.

However, it must be stressed that rural access point detection and observation is far more dangerous. Not only are there less people to hide your activities, but a larger faction of those people who are present will likely be *rabbit hole* occupants or guardians. Failure to exercise due caution may lead to becoming an unwilling underground guest.

For this reason, the author suggests one or more of the following precautions.

1. Be very discreet in rural underground access point observation.
2. Always inform a trusted friend of your intended destination and expected time of return.
3. When possible, use a group recreational outing as cover for your activities.
4. Spread your observation activities over several months, at random times and days of the week.
5. Assume you are being watched at all times, and act appropriately. i.e. As somebody who is enjoying a day in the park.  
 

**Tunnel construction**

The techniques used for *covert tunnel construction* are very different than *civilian tunnel construction*. Covert tunnel construction makes use of a [boring machine that actually melts earth and rock](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_underground01.htm) (by chemical valence disruption), thereby forming a glass like tunnel wall. This has several advantages over civilian tunnel boring methods.

From the perspective of secrecy, the biggest advantage is that little or no waste material (rock, dirt, etc.) is produced by the boring process, thereby alleviating the need for above ground disposal sites. Another advantage is that tunnels can be bored through lose rock, sand, etc. or other locations that would be unsuitable for civilian boring methods (for instance, a river bed). Large underground cavities are also constructed using this technique.  


Covert tunnel boring produces several phenomena that are detectable by surface observation. These phenomena are transitory, and will disappear shortly after tunnel completion. However the presence of these phenomena is unmistakable evidence that covert tunnel construction is taking place.  


The method used to melt earth and rock employs electro-magnetic energy to disrupt the chemical bonds within the material. This method produces little or no heat as a by product of the melting process, and is therefore very stealthy. However it does cause the evaporation of water to take place at an accelerated rate.

Since the method is electro-magnetic, there is a certain amount of ""leakage"" radiation, and this is detectable by the odd effect it produces on surface water. In particular, the *water will appear to rise from the ground as wisps of steam*, even though the ground is cold. This phenomena is very noticeable during rain storms on cold winter nights. The steam does not rise into the air, as it would if the ground was actually warm, but instead forms a layer just above the surface.  


Another side effect of *covert tunnel boring* is a peculiar rippling in road surfaces. This rippling is very slight, and most noticeable while driving at highway speed (55 mph). It is more heard than felt. What sets this ripple apart from normal highway bumps and imperfections is it's consistency. Assuming a constant driving speed, the ripple is perfectly constant. In some cases, the rippled road surface will continue for several miles, without the slightest change in pitch or intensity.  


The ""cold steam"" phenomena is only observable while covert tunnel boring is actually taking place. However the ""road ripple"" phenomena will persist for several weeks after covert tunnel boring is finished.

These phenomena are best observed late at night.  


**Forty trillion dollars**

Despite an ever increasing tax burden, the roads and bridges continue to decline, the cities continue to decay, social security and Medicare benefits continue to dwindle. Today with both husband and wife working full time jobs, the American standard of living is less than 1950 when the husband worked, and the wife stayed home.

In 1950, most government buildings were somewhat dilapidated, having a ""well used"" look about them, while most American homes were modern and well cared for. Today the cities are full of shinny new government office buildings, and many American homes look dilapidated and in need of repair. Government budgets and deficits continue their upward spiral, while the American family is learning how to ""make do"" with less.

Consumer prices continue to rise and wages continue to fall, as the American dream fades, replaced with the nightmarish specter of advancing middleclass poverty. Inexorably, despite every effort to reverse the trend, American wealth has been systematically striped from the people, and transferred to the government  


Something has gone horribly wrong in America.  


For the past several decades, there have been an unbroken chain of government scandals involving over billing and multiple invoicing for items ranging from toilet seats to bombers. Inevitably the media portray these scandals as unscrupulous corporations taking advantage of an inept government bureaucracy.

Sadly these incidents are more pervasive than media reporting indicates, and the truth is far more ominous than mere government incompetence or corporate greed. When the clandestine diversion of tax revenue was no longer sufficient to satisfy the requirements, a second method was instituted. American jobs were outsourced to other countries, thereby allowing the government to repatriate nearly 100% of product and/or service revenue through the foreign purchase of American government bonds.

Since the early 1960s, the American citizenry have been the unwitting victims of government fraud, perpetrated on a scale so vast that it staggers the imagination. When figured in 2004 dollars, the total amount exceeds **40 trillion dollars**.  


What did the American government and it's corporate accomplices do with this almost inconceivable wealth?  


The government has *built a entirely new underground civilization* beneath the abandoned factories, tattered homes, and crime ridden streets that litter the American landscape. In this new society, there is no poverty, no crime or illicit drug use. In this new society, healthcare is affordable, energy is free, public transport is efficient. And you, the American tax payer have paid for it all, without receiving any benefit whatsoever for your Herculean efforts.  


As to why this monstrous crime was committed against the American people, is the topic for a future paper. Suffice it to say, you will not like the motive, nor the eventual disposition planed for you and your loved ones...

An international research group has applied methods of theoretical physics to investigate the electromagnetic response of [the Great Pyramid](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_piramide.htm) to radio waves.

Scientists predicted that under resonance conditions, the pyramid can concentrate electromagnetic energy in its internal chambers and under the base. The research group plans to use these theoretical results to design nanoparticles capable of reproducing similar effects in the optical range.

Such [nanoparticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle) may be used, for example, to develop sensors and highly efficient solar cells.

The study ([Electromagnetic Properties of the Great Pyramid - First Multipole Resonances and Energy Concentration](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/electromagnetic-properties-great-pyramid.pdf)) was published in the *Journal of Applied Physics*.  


While Egyptian pyramids are surrounded by many *""myths""* and *""legends""*, researchers have little scientifically reliable information about their physical properties.

Physicists recently took an interest in how the Great Pyramid would interact with [electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation) of a resonant length.

Calculations showed that in the resonant state, the pyramid can concentrate [electromagnetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_energy) in the its internal chambers as well as under its base, where the third *""unfinished"" chamber* is located.

&amp;#x200B;

[Propagation of electromagnetic waves inside the pyramids of Cheops at different lengths of radio waves \(from 200 to 400 meters\). The black rectangular position of the so-called King's Chamber. Credit: ITMO University, Laser Zentrum Hannover](https://preview.redd.it/gx0ll8msand41.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=698c7ba34e940c31ec0a28193ce4fb02a841bf1f)

 

These conclusions were derived on the basis of numerical modeling and analytical methods of physics.

&gt;The researchers first estimated that resonances in the pyramid can be induced by radio waves with a length ranging from 200 to 600 meters.  
   
Then they made a model of the electromagnetic response of the pyramid and calculated the extinction cross section. This value helps to estimate which part of the incident wave energy can be scattered or absorbed by the pyramid under resonant conditions.  
   
Finally, for the same conditions, the scientists obtained the electromagnetic field distribution inside the pyramid.

In order to explain the results, the scientists conducted a *multipole analysis*. This method is widely used in physics to study the interaction between a complex object and electromagnetic field.

The object scattering the field is replaced by a set of simpler sources of radiation:

&gt;[multipoles](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/multipole)...

The collection of multipole radiation coincides with the field scattering by an entire object.

Therefore, knowing the type of each multipole, it is possible to predict and explain the distribution and configuration of the scattered fields in the whole system.  


The Great Pyramid attracted the researchers while they were studying the interaction between light and dielectric nanoparticles. The scattering of light by nanoparticles depends on their size, shape and refractive index of the source material.

Varying these parameters, it is possible to determine the resonance scattering regimes and use them to develop devices for controlling light at the nanoscale.

&gt;""Egyptian pyramids have always attracted great attention.  
   
We as scientists were interested in them as well, so we decided to look at the Great Pyramid as a particle dissipating radio waves resonantly.  
   
Due to the lack of information about the physical properties of the pyramid, we had to use some assumptions.  
   
For example, we assumed that *there are no unknown cavities inside*, and the building material with the properties of an ordinary limestone is evenly distributed in and out of the pyramid.  
   
With these assumptions made, we obtained interesting results that can find important practical applications,"" says Dr. Sc. Andrey Evlyukhin, scientific supervisor and coordinator of the research.

Now, the scientists plan to use the results to reproduce similar effects at the nanoscale.

&gt;""Choosing a material with suitable electromagnetic properties, we can obtain pyramidal nanoparticles with a promise for practical application in nanosensors and effective solar cells,"" says Polina Kapitainova, Ph.D., a member of the Faculty of Physics and Technology of [ITMO University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITMO_University).",conspiracy,Study Reveals the Great Pyramid of Giza can Focus Electromagnetic energy

**from** [**ThothWeb**](http://www.thothweb.com/) **Website**  
 

 

This article takes a quick look at a controversial site in Illinois called *Burrows Cave.*

In 1982 a large quantity of epigraphic material was been found there by it’s discoverer, a gentleman by the name of **Russell Burrows**. What is claimed by Burrows certainly doesn’t seem to be readily digestible by *mainstream archeologists*, but that of course is neither here nor there.

It has been said that some of the artifacts found are somewhat reminiscent of the Davenport, Iowa, and Wilmington, Ohio, tablets, both of which are of *doubtful authenticity*. Feel free to read the article below, take a look at the images and draw your own conclusions.  


In *Russell Burrows* own words this is is account of how he discovered the cave having stopped to eat his lunch on a bluff that overlooks a valley. He stood up and stepped on the edge of a flat, round rock.

His weight on the side of this rock flipped it as if on a pivot and he fell into a pit below the rock....

&gt;""I found myself falling into a pit which had been secreted beneath a large oval stone which, as I later discovered, was fitted into the pit opening and designed to flip or turn over when stepped on. The unfortunate victim would fall to the bottom of the pit, the stone would swing back in place and the victim would be trapped. I was fortunate: When I stepped on that stone, I was in the act of turning, and the stone, instead of flipping over, slid off to one side and left the pit open.  
I do not actually remember hitting bottom; my next recollection is of hanging on to the lip of the pit by my elbows, in great alarm. I admit that I have a great fear of holes that I’m not ready for, because of snakes. But I found none. When I freed myself and regained my composure, I began to examine the pit and have a look at what was to be the beginning of the greatest adventure of my life... I sat down to calm my nerves, catch my breath and give the situation some thought.""

He found himself in a chamber, with a huge face on one wall, and continues....

&gt;""I did not have to be a genius to figure out that I had stumbled into something that just should not be in Illinois. I have hunted for and found many artifacts of the American Indians and there are many of their sites in my part of the state, but I knew then that this was not American Indian. The face I had been nose to nose with was different from anything I had ever seen. The nose was flat, the eyes were wide-set, and the lips were thick.  
Then, of course, there were all those strange symbols to consider. I had crawled under a ledge and was looking for *petroglyphs* such as I had seen in the pit. I had searched all the walls of the entire length of the valley, and while I had seen a few *scratchings*, I was not all that excited about what I had seen so far. Finally, I gave up on this last place, and decided to quit. In disgust, I tossed my small rock pick against the inside wall of the overhang.  
   
The rock gave out a distinctly unnatural sound: a hollow ring, not what I’d expect from solid rock... As it was now clear that a cave was on the other side... My first entrance was through this portal and into a tunnel-like passage which has a drop-off of about three feet just inside of the portal. I was met with a strong, musty odor. Not of decay, but musty.  
As I moved my head and light around, I saw a full human skeleton reposing on a large block of stone. It scared the hell out of me! Then I began to see other things lying there with those bones. I saw ax heads, spear points, and something else—metal! The skeleton was laid out upon a solid block large enough to hold not only the remains but artifacts as well.  
   
The *artifacts* include ax heads of marble and other stone material, an ax head of what appears to be bronze, a short sword of what appears to be bronze, and other artifacts which might be considered personal weapons. There were also a set of three bronze spears, the longest being about six feet long and the shortest about three feet...  
   
The skeletal remains bear several fine artifacts such as armbands, headbands and other such items, all of gold. ""

The cave is said to lie somewhere along the Skillet Fork of the Little Wabash River in southeastern Illinois.

It supposedly contains 13 elaborately ornamented burial crypts. It is unclear and a matter of controversy who, besides Burrows, has actually been inside the cave . What is known is that Burrows has produced hundreds, if not thousands, of curiously carved stones that he says came from this cave. And some of the artifacts allegedly were not of stone, but of gold.

It is claimed that Burrows sold off enough artifacts to unknown buyers that he was able to place $7 million in Swiss numbered bank accounts. According to Swiss journalist **Luc Buergin**, this money derives from the illegal sale of gold artifacts from the North American burial site.

Other sources claim that Burrows melted down all the gold and sold it as ingots. Still others question whether there ever was any gold in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Edge of the rock cliff, approx. 300 ft. from the entrance to the cave.](https://preview.redd.it/qgvlfiy57nd41.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b64ee2a503f14be2f866d5b6b73fcf632e59f035)

&amp;#x200B;

 

A bizarre collection of *artifacts* was found in a remote cave system in the American State of Illinois. The cavers who made the discovery encountered a derisive response from the first academic experts they approached, experiencing a lot of difficulty finding necessary specialists to help them document and identify the artifacts.

There were problems of site security, disappearing artifacts, as well as people bending data to suit their personal agendas. As the site researcher **Fred Rydholm** remarks: ""For this kind of research you have to be thick-skinned, brave or crazy!"" It’s one thing finding these things, its quite another to explain them.

In the United States the saga of ""Burrows Cave"" has been going on for many years. Over three thousand rock fragments, engraved with a variety of ancient drawings, hieroglyphs and script, were presented to the world by **Russell Burrows** in 1982, who discovered them in a cave system in Southern Illinois. The story of the cave and its contents is so strange, that it’s little wonder it has met strong skepticism.

Recently deciphered for the first time, the stone tablets tell such a wild tale that it will require quite a turn around to accepted history. I was stunned into disbelief when I first laid eyes on the Burrows Cave evidence.

This is no straight forward set of hieroglyphs but, an inexplicable display of several cultures, a huge library preserved on *stone tablets*, collected together and sealed in a cave *sometime around the first millennium*.

&amp;#x200B;

[Gold artifact from the cave, clearly showing Egyptian or Egyptian inspired marks on the gold.](https://preview.redd.it/dvkfnuba7nd41.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd5bde287b9fb60d6501337a7944d3b83aae9b5b)

 

The first photographs of the artifacts were forwarded to me by **Filip Coppens**, who writes about world mysteries in Belgium.

He had heard about my investigation of the anomalies surrounding the presumed hoax of Egyptian hieroglyphs in the NSW Hunter Valley. He was struck by certain odd similarities between the two finds and sent pictures of the carvings which depicted a wolf-headed god, similar to an ""Anubis"" carving photographed in the Hunter Valley.  


Certainly, the *Burrows Cave* boasts a few forms of wolf and jackal-headed deities, from *the classical Anubis to half human versions.* One of the Burrows Cave examples is executed in bas-relief, with accompanying hieroglyphs, embossed on a gold plate. However, there is much more than *wolf-headed deities*, the carved tablets display an extraordinary cultural array. There is a hodgepodge mixture of images and cultural influences which make the artifacts very hard to explain. Even worse, some of the carvings seem amateurish or dimly remembered copies of ancient Greek and Mesopotamian sources.  


Whereas, others involve a high level of skill and obvious knowledge of ancient cosmology. One of the images depicts a ""wolfish"" deity in priestly regalia, wearing a bishop-style hat decorated with a solar emblem. The deity has been identified as the god ""So-Bek-Ra"", who is so pictured on a temple by the Nile. The figure stands, as the lone representative of an ancient priesthood, against an advancing enemy army.

There are also many carved heads, mostly warrior profiles, wearing both Greek, Roman and Egyptian headgear.

&amp;#x200B;

 

Curiously, there are even images of ancient Amer-Indians wearing feathers and facial designs, some showing clear Meso-American style head-dress. Records of ancient travellers? Amongst them are many ancient mystical and sacred designs, as well as maps, pictures of ships and non-indigenous animals.

Astonishingly, one of the carvings portrays the cloven-hooved god **Pan**, holding his pipes and consorting with a nymph. Another stone (as well as an ancient metal coin) excavated from the cave carry the bold image of an elephant underlined with Hebrew characters.

Oddly, an artifact inscribed in exactly the same way was found on a pyramid-shaped stone in Ecuador some years earlier. Some of the carvings are meticulously executed in full bas-relief, some completely carved into the shapes of animals and deities, while other tablets were etched to render the designs.

Even a small collection of solid gold artifacts and coins have been excavated. More than just pictures, there are numerous tablets with coherent linear script carved on them. Examples and influences appear to range from Hebrew and Sumerian to Roman, Greek and Egyptian.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/8knl77jl7nd41.gif

&amp;#x200B;

 

In my correspondence with **Fred Rydholm**, the best theory I could offer, was to speculate about a colony of resourceful pirates, who in some distant time, raided and collected the strange quasi-cultural cache of artifacts for themselves.

Together with an associate Dr **James Scherz**, who helped in the study and documentation of the artifacts, Fred Rydholm found correlations between symbols on the Burrows Cave coins and coins produced by dynasties along the ""Silk Road"" between China and Rome, the most predominant being ""Kushana"" and ""Satavahana"" symbols.

(NOTE: The **Kushanas** once controlled a trade dynasty along the Silk Roads, uniting various ancient people’s in the days of the Romans. They disintegrated with the collapse of the Western part of the Roman Empire about AD 300. The **Satavahana**’s were a seafaring people who lived on the coast of the Indian Ocean and had large ships represented on their coins before they collapsed around 210-230 AD. This suggests the likely time period of early in the first millennium around or after 200 AD.)

Finally, Fred Rydholm was able to report a significant breakthrough with two young Florida researchers, **Paul Schaffranke** and **Brian Hubbard**, who were successful in deciphering some of the inscriptions. Schaffranke and Hubbard recognized them as being one of several ancient Etruscan alphabets which could be translated into ""street Latin"", as used around the time of *Christ*.  


The two Florida men were able to translate stone tablets from the Burrows Cave that the great epigrapher, Dr. **Barry Fell** and others, had insisted were gibberish and could not be translated. Mixed in amongst the *Etruscan script* there is also the added mystery of *Hebrew* and *Egyptian* stone tablets. These were also recently identified and are being translated by Dr. **Arnold Murray** of Arkansas and, **Zena Halpern**, a Hebrew scholar from New York. The Egyptian material is still being assessed. Over half a dozen professional archeologists and linguists have now examined the collection and have been definite in their support of the artifacts’ authenticity.  


At last contact, the Burrow’s team had dug out and classified an astonishing four thousand stone tablets. Another breakthrough came, when a retired engineer **Bill Kreisle**, found several of the stones recorded *accurate maps of the Mississippi River system as it appeared 2000 years ago*. Another map stone shows a river on the Iberian Peninsula (Spain) with the ancient city of Cadiz near its mouth. But, most astonishing of all, they have reported the discovery of several stone crypts, excavated from limestone deep in the cave system, containing a number of interred skeletons with jewellery, artifacts and statuary.  


The mystery people who left the cache of records are, apparently, themselves, buried there. The biggest continuing mystery of the discovery is, WHO carved all these message tablets and from whence came this hidden dynasty of bodies? **Fred Rydholm,** who works with and writes, for the retiring Col. Burrows, reports in his recent correspondence:

&gt;""Although I speak with caution, as it is still too early to say for sure, there are many indications that the bodies found in the crypts are the leaders of a colony of refugees from Ptolemaic Egypt, including a Jewish contingent from the Roman controlled Kingdom of Mauritania.""

**Dr Joseph Mahan**, founder and longtime president of the *Institute for the Study of American Cultures* (**ISAC**), has examined the evidence from the new translations and presents this interesting scenario:

&gt;""They were secretly sent to America in ships provided by the Mauritanian King Juba the Second and his wife Cleopatra Selene, daughter of Cleopatra and Marc Anthony. Included among the refugees were the Queen’s two brothers, who disappeared from Rome (and recorded history) in 17 AD, Ptolemy Philadelphus and Alexander Helios.""

The graves of these people have been the object of a comprehensive historical search for the past two thousand years. We appear to have an advanced and well funded group of priest/scholars who, with the ex-Royal families, escaped the Roman Christianization of Egypt and set off into the unknown somewhere around 200-300 AD. The engraved maps and their collected storehouse of knowledge, shows a deliberate transplanting of culture, perhaps to escape the religious persecution of the Roman Invasion of Egypt and establish a remote colony which could preserve the ancient records.  


Indeed, Dr **Joseph Mahan**, an archeological anthropologist who made a close study of the cave artifacts, reveals a detailed cosmology and religious lore from the cave material which is remarkably similar to that which survived amongst the Indian tribes of the area. The area of Southern Illinois and Indiana, where **Russell Burrows** stumbled into the limestone cave system, is richly endowed with the scattered evidence of several different early cultures which archeologists know too little about.  


There are log tombs, skeletons and artifacts from the Adena culture, which is believed to have developed around 500 BC and to have died out by 200 AD. There was the Hopewell culture, 100 BC to 350 AD.

A mysterious culture concentrated along the Mississippi, known as the ""Mississippian"", crystallized around 800 AD, and was thought to still be in existence when the Spaniards arrived. Researcher, Joseph Mahan, points out, that archeologists have collected evidence for fifty years of an elaborate and uniform *Earth/Sun religion*, associated with the building of flat top temple mounds, which spread out from the Mississippi in the later part of the first millennium.  


These *pyramid-like mounds*, which carried a permanent fire at the top, contained a variety of art, impressed on copper and stone, depicting animal-headed deities, crosses, swastikas, and people in ceremonial dress performing rituals.

Examples of these mound sites are spread from Oklahoma, to Illinois, Alabama and Georgia.

.passenger airliner. 

Were there:

The two pilots went down with the plane and were blown up by explosives that exist on spy jets to prevent information falling into wrong hands. The US media said it was a passenger plane with 80-100 passengers to discourage Iran, India, Pakistan etc. from sending their assets there. However, after Taliban posted video showing insignia indicating it was a Bombardier E-11A, the US media changed their story, admitting the spy jet part, but still lying about the captured CIA agents.

564,OperationMobocracy,evfqie,"It doesn't have to be US currency, but I guess my main interest is in unresolved cases of large volumes of counterfeit currency or long-duration resolved cases where the currency was being passed for years before it could be tracked down.

Are there any contemporary conspiracies about large amounts of existing currency being considered counterfeit?  It seems like anywhere I can get away with spending $100 bill, there's somebody with a pen or light of some kind checking it to see if its legitimate, and this is despite $100s having a fair amount of anti-counterfeiting technology built in.  So people seem actively paranoid about it, despite it being less likely than it was 20 or so years ago.

I'm vaguely familiar with the idea that North Korea was involved in a large-scale counterfeiting operation, although it was a denied accusation and it would make sense that DPRK would get blamed to deflect from some black op involving counterfeiting.

That being said, state sponsored counterfeiting of US currency makes a ton of sense.

566,onn747,evfmvs,"Justin Bieber was on Ellen yesterday to announce his new album release date, but was showing signs of something else going on.

At the beginning of the video, he keeps repeating the words ""thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you"" as Ellen is talking, and near the end of her sentence she sort of hand signals him to stop it, like she's telling him ""let me finish talking first"".

Then Justin changes how hes sitting multiple times. I don't know why he did this.

Then at 1:09, he laughs pretty obnoxiously at the comment Ellen made, almost like he's not entertained with her humor. They cut off his laugh pretty quickly with a loud laughing track over his mic audio. It even seems to be two laugh tracks, etched into one?

Then around 3:17 Justin kind of under reacts to her joke about her co-host being hot across the room. He says ""oh, wow"" and doesn't even bother to look across the room, like hes not very interested or entertained by her joke.

Now this is the part that really stood out for me, at 4:41 he starts tapping his feet, something he did not do for the entire interview, even thru all this fidgeting. This stood out for me because he seems to be foreshadowing his reaction to the gift that Ellen got him. Seconds later he plants his feet on the ground, getting out of the chair while acting super surprised. It's not a surprise to me that he knows what Ellen is giving him, but it's interesting to see him physically foreshadowing it. Almost like he's letting us in on the stage direction?

Last, when holding up the apron, he finishes Ellen's sentences and I don't know the exact way to describe this other than he seems so disengaged to this segment, especially at the end like ""whatever, I'll hold it up, oh we're gonna play a game? Cool..""

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I never thought that this talk show Ellen was real, but maybe it is so fake that Justin is beginning to get annoyed at that type of behavior in Hollywood, people acting like everything is fine and dandy when it is certainty not. Or maybe Justin has found out dirt about Ellen, or he is sick of being everyone's dancing monkey, because EVERY other time on Ellen he has been sitting sturdy, polite, NOT interrupting, and let's just say a ""perfect actor"". . Maybe thru this awakening that he's had he has come to a conclusion that people like Ellen are the worst part of Hollywood. I also believe all of these clues are extremely subtle because Hollywood producers know every trick a celebrity will pull. Like how Kanye acted before he went on his own Ellen rant.

I don't know guys, everyone in the YouTube comment section says he is having anxiety, I do not think that is the case. I think it is very hard to see what he is doing because if it was clearer, it wouldn't have been released... so Justin did subtle things to keep the show rolling, but sent a clear message to those who actually watch whats going on....

Do you see what I see?

Symbolism throughout Back to the Future seems to reference Biff Tannen as Donald Trump. The trilogy also seems to contain a plethora of symbolism/predictive programming/warnings throughout its run-time, including 9/11 and the JFK assassination, to name a couple.

:--:#Trump's connection to Nikola Tesla#:--:

On January 7, 1943 one of the world's most profound and influential inventors met an untimely end. Nikola Tesla died from a Coronary Thrombosis -- the formation of a blood clot within a blood-vessel of the heart. When he died, the only concern amidst the circle of his closest -- and much the same, those who also opposed him; securing his life's works; notes, blueprints, trial-studies etc. Well, as it would turn out, the one person to succeed in this task was none other than the uncle of our current president -- John Trump. So, little Donald Trump could have very likely grown up bouncing on his uncle's knee hearing stories of these wondrous and marvelous inventions.

:--:#Baron's Oddysey#:--:

In 1893 a lawyer by the name of Ingersoll Lockwood wrote a book entitled *Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey*. This novel details the adventures of a young but prominent aristocrat who lives in Germany by the name of Baron Trump. Say, don't we know a young but prominent aristocrat by the same name? He also lives in what's called ""Trump Castle"". Being stricken and wrought in ennui, is given a manuscript by a friend of his father's and written by a man called Don. Isn't that a coincidence. In this manuscript is a detailed account of a ""world within a world"". Which is only accessible via portal in another country. That country being none other than where? ...**RUSSIA!**    
Throughout the book little Baron Trump comes to discover 4 new worlds.    
1. *The Land of Transparent Folk*- The people here wear long black cloaks and hold large black fans to cover their transparent bodies. If they say something untrue the fan envelops them and the become opaque.    
2. *The Land of Sodopsies or Ant People*- Driven into darkness by an ice-age the people here were no longer exposed to natural light or sound and lost their hearing and eyesight. They developed a sign-language using touch.    
3. *The Frozen Land of King Gilead*- Everything here is mad of ice and everyone here has a very low body temperature. Their brains are ""Frozen"" thus causing cognitive response to slow. Actions such as processing information and making decisions takes longer. They dislike anyone with warm body temperatures, which they call ""hot-heads"".    
4. *The Land of the Rattlebrains or Happy Forgetters*- Everyone here only has a memory span of an hour or so. Heads are smaller because no memories are stored. They view this as a virtue since if no one remembers anything, then disagreements and grudges are virtually non-existent.    
I've made no effort to find connections with the worlds in the book and ours besides the lessons to be learned.    

:--:#Ivanka Trump's New Year in Paris#:--:

In the spirit of ""ringing in the new year"" Ivanka Trump posted a series of photos to Instagram of her celebration of new year's in Paris, France. Though these photos may seem like another meaningless ""celebrity flex"" to those who aren't ""in-the-know"", but to those of us who are, a number of these photos stand out and seemingly bare some aspects of significance.    

To detail a few of these photos -- all of which can be found on her Instagram -- I'll describe the photo and afterwards will explain its significance. They all seem to make reference and pay homage to the book *""Race Around the World""* and one or two seem to reference Project Looking Glass.    

1. Ivanka can be seen peering through one of the many telescopes mounted around the top of the Eiffel Tower. She's wearing a Black and white checkered/spotted coat and is wearing maroon-colored gloves. The reference to project looking glass is obvious, but the outfit she is wearing is the exact outfit the protagonist in *""Race Round the World""* can be seen wearing on the cover of the book.    

2. Ivanka is standing on the back-side of a massive clock. She is wearing a long-sleeved black dress. On the cover of *""Race Around the World""* the protagonist is in front of a clock also. On a page inside the book is an illustration of the protagonist stepping off a train wearing a Black long-sleeved dress. Another exact match in wardrobe.    

3. This time Ivanka is facing away from the camera atop the Eiffel Tower. She seems to be admiring the city below, or the horizon. Whatever the case the sky and clouds' colors were edited to match the sky's color on the front of *""Race Around the World""*. Once again she can be seen wearing her black and white checkered coat and maroon gloves.    

4. Both Ivanka and Jared are standing in front of a series of mirrors. Their reflections repeated a number of times. (Looking Glass? Or something I thought of; symbolizing the multiverse theory or multiple realities theory?) In any case the significance isn't in the photo itself but in regards to the caption which read ""Reflecting on the new year💛."" Who uses a yellow heart intentionally? No one I know. A number of people wondered this also and some digging was done. It was discovered that when referencing the color Yellow in the Color-codes for emergencies aboard Naval vessels it correlates with the letter ""Q"" and has the meaning statement ""My vessel is healthy and I request free pratique.""    

These subtle little drops/nudges are too frequent to be purely coincidental.    

**For example:** Melania wore a yellow dress with 2 or 3 flowers -- Hibiscus specifically, on it. Upon further research, it was found out that this specific color of hibiscus goes by the name of ""Perfect Storm."" Coincidence? I think not. Melania has also worn a number of other yellow outfits, such as a one-piece solid yellow suit/jumper with yellow heels.    

Though this ""proofs"" compilation began as a means to answer the question of ""Is Donald Trump a time traveler?"" i may lose a few of the one's reading this here, if i havent already because although unintentional, this is where it seems to begin to collide majorly with QAnon. But regardless of whether you subscribe to the theory or not, i find it just as compelling.    


:--:#QAnon Relations and Tie-ins#:--:    

The photos Ivanka posted to her Instagram were uploaded at 5:48 AM which seems to correspond with Q-drop 1317 which was posted on the fourth of May in 2018 (5 4 8) containing the words ""Racing Around the World"" in a stringer. The Q-drop in question was in regards to John Kerry secretly meeting with Iran to salvage a ""deal"". A stringer read *""Why is Hussein/JK traveling **WW** and meeting with foreign heads of state (some enemies of the US)?"" **WW** stands for **world-wide**. John Kerry met with Kamal Khazari of Iran -- in Paris of all places, while totally undermining the Logan Act which prohibits unauthorized negotiations with foreign nations, on May 13, 2018 -- eight days AFTER the afirementioned q-drop.    

:--:#Revisiting the Race#:--:    

Going back to the book *""Race Around the World""*, there's a page with an illustration depicting the protagonist in a room with a projector. Among some other pages strewn halphazardly across the floor is a drawing of a train that resembles a train drew by a man by the name of Charles Dellschau. Dellschau's artwork was discovered in a scrapbook of sorts containing many more illustrations, sadly only after hia death. This man drew many odd travel-vessel illustrations; all of which had the word ""Trump"" incorperated in some form or another. There was an illustration of an aircraft of sorts that was dubbed the ""Homer-Trump"". Strangely enough the train illustration ive been alluding to this entire time was literally called ""Trump Train"" and when you examine the drawing further you can see a little boy inside a window of the train who people have said mildly resembles Baron Trump, but when you take a look at the conductor it looks strikingly remniscent of none ither than The Donald. These are some scary coincidences to come out of some illustrations from the 1920's. I plan on further researching Charles Dellschau at another time.    

:--:#More correlation between Baron, Q and Ingersoll#:--:    

There was a Q-drop containing a stringer with the words ""An Ingersoll Jumbo Model Pocket Watch"". Well there's a watch company going by the same name as the author of the book I detailed earlier about a Baron Trump, called Ingersoll. Ingersoll's largest model pocket watch is called the ""Trump"". To make matters stranger the Ingersoll company was located at 45 John St. New York. 45?! Isn't Donald Trump the 45th US president, and oh, wait! Isnt John the name of Donald Trumps uncle who was gicen the task of securing Nikola Tesla's belongings?    

:--:#Conclusion#:--:    

At what point can the skeptics admit that coincidences of this magnitude and frequency can no longer be considered coincidences? Let's not forget the number of times that QAnon has warned/informed us of an event/happening days or even weeks before it actually occurs.

I looked into it, and there is indeed a tall bald, athletic looking black guy in a Lakers jersey, Lakers robe and basketball shoes walking around who appears to be at least 6'3"".

One thing I know about Kobe that makes him easily identifiable is his complete lack of a forehead, almost to the point of deformity.  It goes straight back above his browridge, almost like a neanderthal's.  I slowed the video down and was able to get a screen capture of him looking sideways at 3:24, and this tall, bald black guy in lakers garb has the exact same forehead, as seen in the main image below.

You can also see ""Kobe"" walking around between 2:34 to 2:45 and between 4:11-4:18.  It's perhaps worth noting that at 2:44 you can see him standing farther back and on lower ground than the people around him, while having his head still appear above the peoples' heads around him.

Before I get bashed - I'm not saying this is definitely him, but with some of the strange stuff surrounding the ""crash"", i.e. him being passed by Lebron on the all-time scoring list, the grammys and the old cartoon depicting his death by helicopter crash, it's worth looking into.  Some things, like the back of the dollar bill, are hidden in plain sight.

613,JStormCatcher,evd0ot,"A preface: I have been editing at Wikipedia for about 6 years now, and have not come across an article as biased as this.

There is an [article (take the time to skim through it quickly)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Posobiec) on Jack Posobiec, an alt-right Twitter user. Since it was created, it has been the subject of numerous disputes regarding the tone and neutrality of it. Each and every time a dispute has been raised, Wikipedia editors and administrators alike immediately congregate around the article and revert any attempt to make it sound neutral. 

For example, the [section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Posobiec#Political_activities) on Posobiec's political activities is quite literally a shit list which includes unsubstantiated claims. I attempted to convert the section from list format to prose format without making any changes to the claims, but was instantly reverted by [this user who accused me of whitewashing/censoring the article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jack_Posobiec&amp;diff=938057508&amp;oldid=938055805). Ironic, right? I didn't even make any changes to the claims.

I decided to bring the matter to the [talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jack_Posobiec#Bold_edit_rationale_and_further_discussion_to_fix_NPOV), where I could hopefully establish a consensus to make the proposed changes. One of the changes I proposed was removing [this](https://www.phillymag.com/news/2017/09/16/jack-posobiec-trump-fake-news/) article from the reference section, citing it as biased and heavily opinionated, and it was being used to present opinion as fact in the lead section of the article. When asked to explain my rationale behind removing the source, I provided two heavily biased paragraphs from the article in question. Take a look at [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/4n9GoTb.png).

See anything weird?

The two paragraphs I took from the article to demonstrate bias was instantly expunged by a Wikipedia administrator under the rationale of ""non-free content"". To this day the source remains on the page. You may take a look at the article and draw your own conclusions. 

Going back to the ""political activities"" section and the user who accused me of whitewashing the article. He [reported me to administrators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Edit_warring#User:CatcherStorm_reported_by_User:Praxidicae_(Result:_)) for edit warring, citing the ""consensus"" policy at Wikipedia. The consensus policy pretty much states that when it comes to editing at Wikipedia, the majority wins. And the majority of editors at Wikipedia are liberal. 

As a result of that report, I was blocked from editing Wikipedia by the same administrator who censored my comments on the talk page before. The goal was achieved- to prevent editors with valid and opposing viewpoints from challenging the bias on this article.

Here's the last thing I'll say about this. Take a look at [this exchange](https://i.imgur.com/XUirSUB.png) between an editor who supported the changes I proposed and a left-leaning editor. He refers to the biased sources I challenged as ""reliable"" and told the editor he was just ""making shit up"" regarding Pizzagate.

I have appealed my block and as of the time of this post I am waiting for a reply from an administrator. But it's abundantly clear here- Wikipedia has a systemic bias problem.",conspiracy,Systematic bias and censorship at Wikipedia  please take the time to read

&amp;#x200B;

 

As official videographer for the U.S. government, **Kurt Sonnenfeld** was detailed to *Ground Zero on September 11, 2001*, where he spent one month filming 29 tapes:

&gt;""What I saw at certain moments and in certain places ... is very disturbing!""

He never handed them over to the authorities and has been persecuted ever since.

Kurt Sonnenfeld lives in exile in Argentina, where he wrote ""[El Perseguido](http://elperseguido.wordpress.com/)"" (the persecuted). His recently-published book tells the story of his unending nightmare and drives another nail into the coffin of the government’s account of [the 9/11 events](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_911.htm).

Below is an exclusive interview by Voltairenet.

&amp;#x200B;

[Kurt Sonnenfeld and unidentified search and rescue specialist in subterranean void beneath Ground Zero.](https://preview.redd.it/ktl41hzl6ld41.jpg?width=399&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bdbcdeddde7207afd7ac58300370253f72e1507)

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Introduction**  


Kurt Sonnenfeld graduated from the University of Colorado (USA) with studies in *International Affairs and Economics*, as well as in *Literature and Philosophy*. He worked for the United States government as official videographer and served as *Director of Broadcast Operations for the Federal Emergency Management Agency* ([FEMA](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_FEMA.htm))’s *National Emergency Response Team.*

Additionally, Kurt Sonnenfeld was contracted by several other governmental agencies and programs for classified and “sensitive” operations at military and scientific installations throughout the United States.  


On September 11, 2001, the area known as “Ground Zero” was sealed from the public eye. Sonnenfeld, however, was given unrestricted access enabling him to document for the investigation (that never took place) and provide some “sanitized” pool video to virtually every news network in the world. The tapes that reveal some of the anomalies which he discovered at Ground Zero are still in his possession.  


Accused of a crime that did not occur in a manifest frame-up scenario, Kurt Sonnenfeld has been persecuted across continents.

After several years of fear, injustice and isolation, he has decided to take a public stand against the Government’s official story and is prepared to submit his material to the close scrutiny of reliable experts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Interview**

&gt;**Voltaire Network:** Your autobiographical book titled ""[El Perseguido](http://elperseguido.wordpress.com/)"" (the persecuted) was recently published in Argentina where you live in exile since 2003. Tell us who is persecuting you.  
**Kurt Sonnenfeld:** Although it is autobiographical, it is not my life story. Rather it is a history of the extraordinary events that have happened to me and my family at the hands of U.S. authorities over the course of more than seven years, spanning two hemispheres, after my tour of duty at Ground Zero and becoming an inconvenient witness.  
   
**VN:** You explained that your request for refugee status within the terms of the Geneva 1951 Convention is still being considered by the Argentinean Senate, while in 2005 you were granted political asylum, albeit, on a provisional basis.  
   
That probably makes you the first U.S. citizen in that situation! And no doubt the first U.S. Government official with direct exposure to the events surrounding September 11, 2001 who has “blown the whistle”.  
   
Is this what drove you into exile?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[With wife Paula, testifying before Senate](https://preview.redd.it/tdlnln1r6ld41.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2a60cf77629a89e59de0b08bb00c93af93d7e1b)

&amp;#x200B;

 

**KS:** A refugee is a person who has been forced to leave (or stay away from) his or her country for reasons of persecution. It’s undeniable that many people have been persecuted unfairly as a result of the quasi-fascist laws and policies brought about by the shock of September 11, 2001, and they deserve refugee status.

But the fact is, requesting refugee status is a risky and dangerous step to take. America is the world’s only remaining “superpower”, and dissent has been effectively repressed. Any person who requests refugee status on political grounds is by nature making an extreme statement of dissent. And if your request is denied, what do you do? Once you make the request, there can be no going back.  


Personally, I wasn’t forced to leave the United States, and I certainly did not “flee”. At the time I was still fairly oblivious to what was actually brewing against me. I hadn’t connected the dots yet; so that when I left in early 2003 I had every intention of returning.

I came to Argentina for a short respite; to try to recuperate after all that had happened to me.

I traveled here freely, with my own passport, using my own credit cards. But because of an incredible series of events, I have since been forced into exile, and I haven’t been back.  
 

**VN:** What type of events are you referring to?  


**KS:** I’ve suffered false accusations for “crimes” that demonstrably did not happen, abusive imprisonment and torture as a result of those accusations, as well as outrageous calumnies against my reputation, death threats, kidnap attempts and several other violations of civil and human rights as denounced by numerous international accords.

My return to the United States would not only be a continuation of those violations, but would be aggregated by the separation - perhaps permanent - from my wife and three-year old twin daughters, the only thing remaining that I have to live for.

And then, after the impossibility of receiving a fair trial for a crime that did not happen, I could be subject to the death penalty.  
 

**VN:** In 2005, the U.S. Government lodged a request to have you extradited, which was turned down by a Federal Judge. Then, in 2007, the Argentinean Supreme Court – in a show of integrity and independence - turned down the U.S. appeal, but your Government persisted. Can you shed some light on the situation ?  


**KS:** In 2008, the US government appealed again, this time with absolutely no legal foundation, to the Supreme Court, which will surely uphold the two already unassailable rulings made by the Federal Judge.  


In one of those rulings, it was also noted that there were too many “sombras”, or shadows, surrounding my case. There were many, many obvious fabrications in the extradition order sent here by US authorities, and, thankfully, we were able prove that.

The fact that there were so many fabrications has actually served to support my request for asylum. We were also able to show that we had been subject to a prolonged campaign of harassment and intimidation from US intelligence services. As a result, since my family has been assigned round-the-clock police protection.

As one senator has noted about my case:

&gt;“It is their behavior that belies their true motivations”.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Sonnenfeld and his family are frequently harassed, followed, and photographed, as shown in this photo.](https://preview.redd.it/gjpajmit6ld41.jpg?width=388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c15447311a67c61199b9fbfdb7859353c49fe2a)

&amp;#x200B;

 

**VN:** They want you pretty badly for a “crime that did not happen”! How do you account for such doggedness? As a FEMA official, you must have been trusted by your government. At what point did the situation capsize?  


**KS:** In hindsight, I realize now that the situation had capsized some time before I actually became aware that it had capsized. Initially, the false accusation against me was completely irrational, and I was totally destroyed by it. It is incredibly difficult to have suffered the loss of someone you love to suicide, but to then be accused of it is too much to bear.

The case was dismissed based on a mountain of evidence that overwhelmingly absolved me (Nancy, my wife, had left behind a suicide note and a journal of suicidal writings; she had a family history of suicide; etc.). The prosecution was 100% sure of my innocence before requesting the dismissal of charge.  


But the sustained incarceration even AFTER it was indicated that I was to be freed was what proved to me that something was happening under the surface. I was held in jail for FOUR MONTHS after my lawyers were informed that the case was to be dismissed and was finally released in June 2002.

During that time, an amazing series of strange events began to occur. While still being held, I had a telephone conversation with FEMA officials in an effort to resolve the issue, but I realized that I was considered “compromised”. I was told it had been agreed that “the agency had to be protected”, especially in light of the upheaval that was threatening with the implementation of the “Patriot Act” and the expected usurpation that would come with the new *Department of Homeland Security*.

After all the dangers I had risked, all hardship and difficulties I had endured for them for almost 10 years, I felt betrayed. It left a void in my soul.  


Because of their abandonment, I told them I didn’t have the tapes, that I gave them to “some bureaucrat” in New York, and that they would have to wait until I was released to retrieve any other documents in my possession. Soon after that conversation, my house was “seized”, the locks were changed, and men were observed by neighbors entering my house, though there is no record in the court of their entry, as would be required.

When I was finally released, I discovered that my office had been ransacked, my computer was missing, and that my tape library in my basement had been dug through and several were missing. Men were constantly parked on the street near my house, my security system was “hacked” more than once, outdoor security lights were unscrewed, etc., to the point that I went to stay with some friends at their condo in the mountains, which was then ALSO broken into.  


Anyone who looks for the truth recognizes that there has been an amazing series of irregularities in this case and that an appalling injustice is being carried out on me and my loved ones.

This intense campaign to return me to American soil is a false pretext for other darker motives.  
 

**VN:** You have suggested that you observed things at Ground Zero that did not tally with the official account. Did you do or say anything to arouse suspicion in this respect?  


**KS:** In that same telephone call I said that I would “go public”, not only with my suspicions about the events surrounding September 11, 2001, but about several contracts I had worked on in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**VN:** What are your suspicions based on?  


**KS:** There were many things, in hindsight, that were disturbing at Ground Zero. It was odd to me that I was dispatched to go to New York even before the second plane hit the South Tower, while the media was still reporting only that a “small plane” had collided with the North Tower - far too small of a catastrophe at that point to involve FEMA.

FEMA was mobilized within minutes, whereas it took ten days for it to deploy to New Orleans to respond to Hurricane Katrina, even with abundant advance warning!

It was odd to me that *all cameras were so fiercely prohibited* within the secured perimeter of Ground Zero, that the entire area was declared a crime scene and yet the “evidence” within that crime scene was so rapidly removed and destroyed.

And then it was very odd to me when I learned that FEMA and several other federal agencies had already moved into position at their command center at Pier 92 on September 10th, one day before the attacks!

&amp;#x200B;

[Rubber landing-gear tyres visible in evidence container marked “FBI Plane Parts Only.”](https://preview.redd.it/xlqk63az6ld41.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5591af2a7c98be5e58a3627f9593cb150eee76b9)

&amp;#x200B;

 

We are asked to believe that all four of the “indestructible” black boxes of the two jets that struck the twin towers were never found because they were *completely vaporized*, yet I have footage of the rubber wheels of the landing gear nearly undamaged, as well as the seats, parts of the fuselage and a jet turbine that were absolutely not vaporized.

This being said, I do find it rather odd that such objects could have survived fairly intact the type of destruction that turned most of the Twin Towers into thin dust.

And I definitely harbor some doubts about the authenticity of the “jet” turbine, *far too small to have come from one of the Boeings!*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

What happened with Building 7 is incredibly suspicious.

I have video that shows how curiously small the rubble pile was, and how the buildings to either side were untouched by Building Seven when it collapsed. It had not been hit by an airplane; it had suffered only minor injuries when the Twin Towers collapsed, and there were only small fires on a couple of floors. There’s no way that building could have imploded the way it did without controlled demolition.

Yet the [collapse of Building 7](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_911_40.htm) was hardly mentioned by the mainstream media and suspiciously ignored by the 911 Commission.  
 

**VN:** Reportedly, the underground levels of WTC-7 contained sensitive and undoubtedly compromising archival material. Did you come across any of it?  
**KS:** The Secret Service, the Department of Defense, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of Emergency Management’s “Crisis Center” occupied huge amounts of space there, spanning several floors of the building.

Other federal agencies had offices there as well.

After September 11, it was discovered that concealed within Building Seven was the *largest clandestine domestic station of the Central Intelligence Agency* outside of Washington DC, a base of operations from which to spy on diplomats of the United Nations and to conduct counterterrorism and counterintelligence missions.  


There was no underground parking level at Seven World Trade Center. And there was no underground vault. Instead, the federal agencies at Building Seven stored their vehicles, documents and evidence in the building of their associates across the street.

Beneath the plaza level of US Customs House (Building 6) was a large underground garage, separated off from the rest of the complex’s underground area and guarded under tight security. This was where the various government services parked their bomb-proofed cars and armored limousines, counterfeit taxi cabs and telephone company trucks used for undercover surveillance and covert operations, specialized vans and other vehicles.

Also within that secured parking area was access to the sub-level vault of Building 6.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Approaching the entrance to the sub-level areas of Building 6](https://preview.redd.it/3tlnex757ld41.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=662568036e1fbe5217b07a2696a1f2c9d5928fd8)

&amp;#x200B;

 

When the North Tower fell, the US Customs House (Building 6) was crushed and totally incinerated.

Much of the underground levels beneath it were also destroyed. But there were voids. And it was into one of those voids, recently uncovered, that I descended with a special Task Force to investigate. It was there we found the *security antechamber to the vault*, badly damaged. At the far end of the security office was the wide steel door to the vault, a combination code keypad in the cinderblock wall beside it.

But the wall was cracked and partially crumbled, and the door was sprung partially open. So we checked inside with our flashlights. Except for several rows of empty shelves, there was nothing in the vault but dust and debris. It had been emptied.

Why was it empty? And when could it have been emptied?  
 

**VN:** Is this what set alarm bells ringing for you?  


**KS:** Yes, but not immediately. With so much chaos, it was difficult to think. It was only after digesting everything that the “alarm bells” went off.  


Building Six was evacuated within twelve minutes after the first airplane struck the North Tower. The streets were immediately clogged with fire trucks, police cars and blocked traffic, and the vault was large enough, 15 meters by 15 meters by my estimate, to necessitate at least a big truck to carry out its contents.

And after the towers fell and destroyed most of the parking level, a mission to recover the contents of the vault would have been impossible. The vault *had to have been emptied* *before* *the attack.*  


I’ve described all of this extensively in my book, and it’s apparent that things of importance were taken out of harm’s way before the attacks. For example, the **CIA** didn’t seem too concerned about their losses. After the existence of their clandestine office in Building Seven was discovered, an agency spokesman told the newspapers that a special team had been dispatched to scour the rubble in search of secret documents and intelligence reports, though there were millions, if not billions of pages floating in the streets.

Nevertheless, the spokesman was confident.

&gt;“There shouldn’t be too much paper around,” he said.

&amp;#x200B;

 

And Customs at first claimed that everything was destroyed.

That the heat was so intense that everything in the evidence safe had been baked to ash. But some months later, they announced that they had broken up a huge Colombian narco-trafficking and money-laundering ring after miraculously recovering crucial evidence from the safe, including surveillance photos and heat-sensitive cassette tapes of monitored calls.

And when they moved in to their new building at 1 Penn Plaza in Manhattan, they proudly hung on the lobby wall their Commissioner’s Citation Plaque and their big round US Customs Service ensign, also miraculously recovered, in pristine condition, from their crushed and cremated former office building at the World Trade Center.  
 

**VN:** You weren’t alone on the Ground Zero assignment. Did the others notice the same anomalies? Do you know whether they have they also been harassed?  


**KS:** Actually there were a few people on two different excursions that I know about. Some of us even discussed it afterwards. They know who they are and I hope that they will come forward, but I’m sure they have strong apprehensions as to what will happen to them if they do.

I will leave it to them to decide, but there is strength in numbers.  
 

**VN:** With the publication of your book, you have become a ""whistleblower"" - yet another step on which there is no going back!

There must be many people with inside knowledge about what really happened or did not happen on that fateful day. Yet, hardly any have stepped up to the plate and certainly no one who was directly involved in an official capacity. This is what makes your case so compelling. Judging from your ordeal, it is not difficult to imagine what is holding such people back.  


**KS:** Actually, there are several other very smart and credible people blowing whistles, too. And they are being discredited and ignored. Some are being harassed and persecuted, as I am.  


People are gripped by fear. Everybody knows that if you question US authority you will have problems in some way or another. At minimum you will be discredited and dehumanized. Most likely you’ll find yourself indicted for something completely unrelated, like tax evasion — or something even worse, as in my case. Look at what happened to Secret Service whistle-blower Abraham Bolden, for example, or to chess master Bobby Fischer after he showed his disdain for the US. There are countless other examples.

In the past I asked friends and associates to speak out for me to counter all the lies being planted in the media, and all of them were terrified as to the ramifications to themselves and their families.  
 

**VN:** To what degree would your discoveries at Ground Zero expose the government’s involvement in those events? Are you familiar with the investigations that have been carried out by numerous scientists and qualified professionals which not only corroborate your own findings but, in some instances, far exceed them? Do you regard such people as ""conspiracy nuts""?  


**KS:** At the highest levels in Washington, DC, someone knew what was going to happen. They wanted a war so badly that they at least let it happen and most likely even helped it happen.  


Sometimes it seems to me that the “nuts” are those who hold to what they’ve been told with an almost religious fervor despite all of the evidence to the contrary — the ones who won’t even consider that there was a conspiracy. There are so many anomalies to the “official” investigation that you can’t blame it on oversight or incompetence.

I am familiar with the scientists and qualified professionals to whom you refer, and their findings are convincing, credible, and presented according to scientific protocol - in stark contrast to the findings of the “official” investigation. In addition, numerous intelligence agents and government officials have now come forward with their very informed opinions that the 9-11 Commission was a farce at best or a cover-up at worst.

My experience at Ground Zero is but one more piece of the puzzle.  
 

**VN:** Those events are nearly 8 years behind us. Do you consider that uncovering the truth about 9/11 continues to be an important objective? Why?  


**KS:** It is of absolute importance. And it will be equally as important in 10 years, or even 50 years if the truth still has not been exposed. It is an important objective because, at this point in history, many people are too credulous to whatever “authority” tells them and too willing to follow.

People in a state of shock seek guidance. People who are afraid are manipulable. And being able to manipulate the masses results in unimaginable benefits to a lot of very rich and very powerful people. War is incredibly expensive, but the money has to go somewhere. War is very profitable for the very few. And somehow [their sons always end up in Washington DC](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_bush.htm), making the decisions and writing the budgets, while the sons of the poor and the poorly-connected always end up on the enemy lines, taking their orders and fighting their battles.

The enormous [black-budget](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_blackbudget.htm) of the US Department of Defense represents an unlimited money machine for the military-industrial complex, figuring in the multi-trillions of dollars, and it will continue to be so until the masses wake up, recuperate their skepticism and demand accountability.

Wars (and false pretexts for war) will not cease until the people realize the true motive of war and stop believing “official” explanations.  
 

**VN:** What is referred to as the *9/11 Truth Movement*, has been asking for a new, independent investigation into those events. Do you think that the [Obama Administration](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_obama.htm) holds out some hope in this respect?  


**KS:** I really hope so, but I’m skeptical. Why would the leadership of any established government willingly undertake any action that would result in a serious compromise to their authority? They will prefer to maintain the status quo and *leave the things the way they are*. The conductor of the train has been changed, but has the train changed its course? I doubt it.

The push has to come from the public, not only domestically, but internationally, like your group is doing.  
 

**VN:** A number of human rights and activist groups are supporting your plight, not least Peace Nobel Prize winner Adolfo Pérez Esquivel. How have the Argentinean people in general responded to your situation?  


**KS:** With an incredible outpouring of support.

The military dictatorship is still fresh in the collective memory of most of the people here, along with the knowledge that the dictatorship (along with the other South American dictatorships at the time) was backed by the CIA, directed at the time by [George Bush Senior](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/bush/bushb.htm).

They remember well the torture centers, the secret prisons, the thousands of people “disappeared” for their opinions, the living in daily fear.

They know that the United States today will do the same thing if they consider it beneficial, that they will invade a country to achieve their political and economic interests and then manipulate the media with fabricated “causus belli” to justify their conquests.

Modern Genetic Research Confirming Cayce’s Story. This section adapted from Mound Builders: Edgar Cayce's Forgotten Record of Ancient America by **Gregory L. Little.**  


DNA analysis on Native Americans began in the 1980s, but with rapid technological improvements. research intensified in the early 1970s. Several teams of genetics researchers at prominent American universities have been conducting numerous studies. Although results from early studies showed the expected Siberian-Asia ancestry of the majority of modem Native American tribes, things took an unexpected turn in 1997.

At that point it was found that a small percentage of modem Native Americans have an unusual type of DNA then known to exist out’, in a few locations in Europe and the Middle East. Subsequent research indicated that the European DNA was no the result of genetic mixing after Columbus. In addition, the same DNA was later found in the hone of an ancient American burial confirming that people carrying this unique DNA had entered America in ancient times.

However, in July 200, this unique gene was also found in a small tribe living in the northern Gobi Desert area. The DNA research initially seemed to promise solid proof of not only where the ancient Americans came from, but also when they came. However as might be expected, ancient DNA research has become a highly contentious issue with several competing sides. Most of’ the DNA research on Native American Indians has been done utilizing mitochondria. Every cell in our body contains hundreds to thousands of these tiny, football-shaped organelles. The mitochondria process glucose (sugar) into a usable form of energy for all of our body’s functions.

The mitochondria are believed to be an evolutional form of bacteria that adapted into a symbiotic relationship with multi-celled life forms. Thus, the mitochondria have their own unique DNA, which is simpler and easier to analyze than the human DNA found in the nucleus. Mitochondrial DNA (usually abbreviated as mtDNA) is passed to offspring only’ through the egg. Thus, it is not a combination of male and female genes. It is a haploid gene — meaning that it has only’ one dose of chromosomes.

The haploid mitochondrial DNA shows only the female lineage of a person. Diploid genes are two sets of combined chromosomes, the female set coming from the egg, the male chromosomes from the sperm. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is categorized into several types and groups termed haplotypes and haplogroups. That is, there are variations in the genetic cycle of mitochondria that fit into clusters. These clusters can trace lineage far back into time. There are 39 different, distinct mtDNA groups into which all humans fit and there are variations on these types.

While mtDNA analysis is not only easier than other forms of genetic testing, it has a further advantage. All DNA mutates over time. But mtDNA has a fairly’ steady rate of mutation that permits a reasonably accurate estimate of exactly’ when a particular group of people migrated from their primary group.

Thus, two important factors can be determined through analysis of mtDNA.

&gt;First, a living person (or the mtDNA from the remains of a deceased person) can be tested to determine the specific racial group from which the individual came.  
Secondly, the approximate time when that individual’s ancestors migrated from their primary racial group can be determined.

One way to view mtDNA testing is that it may be able to provide a racial family tree extending back to the beginning of humanity. The current idea in mtDNA analysis is that ancestory on the female side can eventually, be traced back to a genetic ""Eve."" The 39 types of mtDNA were presumably derived from this Eve. Whether this idea will be completely confirmed by research remains to be seen.

However, mtDNA testing has confirmed several oral traditions passed down through many generations in several tribes. For example, the indigenous people of Hawaii and Polynesia have long asserted that their ancestors frequently traveled back and forth and that they 'shared ancestor’.

Genetic testing showed that these two groups were related and confirmed the migratory’ legends of these peoples.

**Confirming the Siberian Migration**

The first research on living Native American tribes showed they were comprised of four distinct mtDNA haplogroups called A, B, C, and D. This means that the Native Americans are derived from four different lineages.

These haplogroups were also found in native populations in Central and South America. Utter mtDNA research utilizing ancient remains recovered in the Americas validated these four haplogroups. Three of these haplogroups, A, C, and D are found primarily in Siberian Asia.

The B haplogroup, however, is found only in aboriginal groups in Southeast Asia. China, Japan, Melanesia, and Polynesia.  
 

**Confirming a South Pacific and Japanese Migration**

Based on the mutations found in the mtDNA, most researchers think that groups A, C and D, entered America from Siberia across Beringia some time around 35.000 B.C. Group B, they assert, probably came to America from the South Pacific or Japan via boats. It is believed the B groups began this migration not long after the A, C, and D groups arrived. However, the majority of the B group arrived about 11.000 B.C. This leaves open the possibility of several migrations by the B group from different locations.

It should be noted that a few geneticists have proposed that each of these tour haplogroups came in four separate migrations. And many Clovis supporters argue that all the groups migrated together.  
 

**An Unknown and Unexpected Migration Group Confirmed**

In 1997, a fifth mtDNA haplogroup was identified in Native Americans. This group, called ‘""X,"" is present in three percent of living Native Americans. Haplogroup X was not then found in Asia, but was found only in Europe and the Middle East where two to four percent of the population carry it. In those areas, the X haplogroup has primarily been found in parts of Spain, Bulgaria, Finland, Italy, and Israel. In July 2001, a research letter was published in the American Journal of Human Genetics, relating that a few people with the ‘X' type had been identified in a tribe located in extreme southern Siberia.

These people, called the Altasians, or Altaics, as Russian geneticists refer to them, have always lived in the Gobi Desert area. Archaeologists and geneticists are certain that the presence of ""X"" in America is not the result of historic intermarriages. It is of ancient origin. In addition, the 'X’ type has now been found in the ancient remains of the **Basque**. Among Native American tribes, the X haplogroup has been found in small numbers in the Yakima, Sioux, and Navaho tribes. It has been found to a larger degree in the Ojibway, Oneota, and Nuu-Chah-Nulth tribes.

The X haplogroup has also been discovered in ancient remains in Illinois near Ohio and a 'few’ other areas near the Great Lakes. It has not (so far) been found in South or Central American tribes including the Maya. The X haplogroup appears to have entered America in limited numbers perhaps as long ago as 34.000 B.C. Around 12,000 B.C. to 10.000 B.C. it appeared in much greater numbers.

It is important to note that not all Native American tribes have been categorized by mtDNA analysis and that relatively few ancient remains have been tested.  
 

**The Significance of mtDNA Research**

The mtDNA research confirms most of’ the other new findings in archaeology. The Americas were settled early and many different racial groups came. Several different waves of migration probably occurred. The initial wave seems to have occurred around 35.000 B.C. However, it may have been far earlier since some of the recent radiocarbon dates that have emerged from areas like California and the southwest point to 50,000 B.C. But it must be kept in mind that mtDNA analysis is still in its infancy. Not all current Native American tribes and very few remains have been tested.

But the picture the mtDNA research findings paint of ancient America is astonishing. It may’ seem that the apparent widespread presence of the X type (from Canada and Washington State, to Arizona, to the Plains, to the Great Lakes area) could indicate a wide initial dispersal. However, the history of several of these tribes tells a different 'story’. The X type in ancient America appears to be linked to the Iroquois.

This tribe, of course, was, according to **Cayce**, partly the remnant of Atlantean survivors from its final destruction in 10.000 B.C. The finding of the X group in the north Gobi-dwelling Altasians is hailed as proof that all American migrations came from Siberia via the Bering Straits, yet it seems unlikely.

With the X type being present in the Middle East, Europe, [the ancient **Basques**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_genetica12.htm), and America, *a migration from the Gobi to all of these areas is doubtful*.

The Cayce readings cite a series of large and small migrations of Atlanteans to very specific parts of the world. These migrations occurred at several times, but especially during the years approaching 10.000 B.C. One of these places was to the Gobi in extreme southern Siberian Asia.

If we assume that haplotype X originated from Cayce’s Atlantis, some of the X haplotype should be found in the Gobi region— but very little of this group should be found elsewhere in Siberia. This is what has been found.  
 

**B Haplogroup may Originate from Mu**

The B haplogroup, found only in aboriginal groups in Southeast Asia, China, Japan, Melanesia, and Polynesia, may represent Cayce’s [people of Mu](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_lemuria.htm). Both Chinese and Japanese archaeologists take the idea of Mu seriously, and the B haplogroup findings closely match the story Cayce told about the continent. Most of the people of Mu who escaped the destruction in 50,000 B.C. escaped to China, India, and Japan. Some time later, descendants of these peoples could have traveled to America.

While [**Cayce**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_cayce.htm) said that some people from Mu entered the Americas about 50,000 B.C., he did not indicate that date as the time period when the majority of them came. We only know that it was after 50,000 B.C. and prior to 28,000 B.C.  
 

**A,C,&amp;D Haplogroups – from Siberia?**

The Cayce readings do indicate that people entered the Americas from both the east and west in 28.000 B.C. These migrants came from [Atlantis.](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_atlantida.htm) China, and from ""across the Pacific."" The 28.000 B.C. date matches well with the haplogroups A, B, C, and D proposed dates of entry into America. The Cayce readings do have references to the Bering Straits, but Cayce did not relate that there were migrations across it.

In fact, no one ever thought to ask him about this, so it remains an open question in the Cayce story. But the A, C, and D haplogroups clearly originated in Siberia just as the archaeologists have speculated. Cayce stated that the ""yellow"" or Mongol race of humanity originated in the 'Gobi and gradually’ spread throughout Asia.

Thus, according to Cayce, haplogroups A, C, and D probably originated in the Gobi and would be the migrations Cayce cited as coming from ""across the Pacific.""  
 

**The Atlantean Haplogroup may be X**

**Cayce** indicated that the largest migration from [Atlantis](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_atlantida.htm) occurred just before 10.000 B.C. The majority of these Atlantean survivors went to the Northeastern coastal areas of America and Canada becoming the Iroquois. It should be recalled that Cayce also stated that not all of the Iroquois were Atlantean. The Atlanteans migrating to the Americas merged with the people already present in America by that time.

The Atlanteans became kaders of the tribes. Cayce’s story’ makes it clear that the Atlanteans had serious disputes among themselves that were reflected in ongoing violent conflict. (This was the struggle between the Belial and Law of One groups.)

This is confirmed by the Iroquois’ ancient history that tells of constant battles resulting in distant displacements of entire tribes to ensure their survival. Perhaps the most astonishing confirmation of Cayce’s story of ancient America is the presence of haplogroup X. What is known is that the X haplogroup first showed up in America perhaps 34,000 years ago, but its main entry occurred in 10,000 B.C.

These dates match Cayce’s timeframe for Atlantean migrations as well as the occurrence of X in the specific tribes predicted by his statements. The X group also appears to have shown up in ancient Iberia and in the **Basques** about the same time as well as in the Gobi.

These dates match Cayce’s story of the final two destructions of Atlantis and the resulting migrations to these areas.",conspiracy,DNA Analysis on Native Americans

In the beginning… there were many [myths of creation](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_mitoscreacion.htm).

Many of the great spiritual traditions told of how the material world came into being out of a nameless domain.

Some traditions have spoken of the 'cosmic egg' from which form emerged; or, as in the Old Testament, out of the dark and formless deep where the spirit of *God* moved:

&gt;In the beginning *God* created the heaven and the earth; and the earth was without form, and void; and darkness \[was\] upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of *God* moved upon the face of the waters.  
**(Genesis 1:1-1:2)**

The Hindu spiritual traditions of India speak of an underlying reality that is Brahman - a reality that is eternal and eternally unchanging.

The world of space and time that we are familiar with is known as *lila*, which describes our physical world as the playground of unceasing creative play within Brahman.

In terms of this cosmology humanity is indeed at play in the fields of the *Lord*. The ancient Hindu Vedic rishis told that the essence of all things in the material world belonged to *Akasha*.

A Sanskrit term, Akasha refers to the fifth element of the cosmos, beyond,

&gt;air (vata)  
fire (agni)  
water (jal)  
earth (prithivi)

The concept of Akasha is similar to the later western notions of **ether** \- a space field that contains all the elements within itself.

In the late 6th century BC **Pythagoras** spoke of the 'ether' as the fifth element of the world, in addition to earth, air, fire and water.

In more modern terminology we see similarities with the notion of the underlying quantum vacuum (or plenum, matrix) that is described as the energetic sea of the cosmos from which matter-reality manifests. The Akasha/ether/quantum matrix is the cosmic energy domain from which everything has emerged, and into which everything will ultimately return.  


Western streams of philosophic thought also speak of a domain beyond space and time.

According to **Plato** there was a realm of Forms and Ideas - a domain of Pure Forms - beyond our space and time, and that our material world is only an image or copy of this real, pure world beyond.

This pure realm was also spoken of by other Hellenic philosophers:

&gt;Pythagoras referred to it as Kosmos, and Plotinus as The One.

Perhaps the most famous illustration of Plato's thinking is his [allegory of The Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave).

In this allegory Plato describes a group of people who have lived all their lives chained up and facing the wall of a cave.

All they can see is the blank cave wall that lies in front of them. The opening of the cave is behind them, and the light that enters casts shadows on the far wall of the cave. Upon this wall, day after day, the chained people watch shadows move across as they cannot turn around and see the 'real' objects that pass behind them. Thus, they view these shadows as their reality and ascribe forms, reason, and life to them.

This is the illusion - the shadows from beyond - that we ascribe as [our 'reality](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_consciousscience.htm#Reality)' and give meaning to.  


Similarly, the Chinese sage **Lao-Tze** (or Laozi) spoke of all things originating in the Tao/Dao as the unseen root of all material things. The Tao is both the originator (the source) of all things, and the destination to which all things eventually return. It is the unobservable and nameless no-space, no-time, no-form essence that our words fail.

Are these non-spaces the realms where our gods dwell?  


Our myths may be the only threads that connect us with such realms; they are the narratives that remain in the earthly domain to help jolt our memories.

In his theory of [anamnesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamnesis_(philosophy)) Plato says humanity possesses knowledge of its past, only that we have forgotten this knowledge and so we need to rediscover the knowledge within us.

Plato wrote that humanity could only know the 'real world' in the form of memories. That is, human thought was really a form of recollection, and that humankind generally existed within a state of collective amnesia, having only fragments of recollection as reference points for reality.

Plato was suggesting that humanity had lost - or fallen - from an earlier state of heightened awareness and now had only traces of this memory in their collective psyche as a reminder. In ancient Greek, truth is called *aletheia* which means not forgetting; and in Greek mythology before the human soul incarnates into this world it drinks from Lethe, the river of Forgetfulness and one of the five rivers of the underworld, so that it cannot remember its divine origins.

Similarly, there is a Jewish legend that speaks of how we are struck on the mouth by an angel before birth so that we cannot speak of our pre-birth divine origins.  


Humanity is being told through these and other related myths that we need to learn how to remember - that truth is re-collection, not cognition.

We arrive in this earthly reality full of cosmic glory, only that we lack the key, the crucial guide, to unlock our memories and unleash the flood of knowing.

When we come across the scattered symbols and signs of truth, we inherently intuit and sense deep down some great significance.

Yet our minds are incapable of grasping the intangibleness of this hidden mystery. And that is how our lives play out, as we slip as souls within a playground of signs that are invested with ultimate meaning.

We need to find the [Arianne's thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne's_thread_(logic)) to help us through this labyrinth that we find ourselves in, and to remember that we have our origins in the Primary Imagination.

Our lives are not only unique creations but are acts of re-creation. They are attempts at entering once again into a lost remembrance which lies so far and yet so close to us.

The 13th century Persian poet **Jalāl ad-Dīn Rūmī** wrote that,

&gt;'The Truth is closer to us than our own jugular vein.'

And yet so vain do we search, as if we have fallen away from **true** **remembrance**.  
 

&amp;#x200B;

**Myths Lost and Regained**  
One of humanity's most enduring mythic narratives is what is commonly referred to as *the Fall*.

What this generally suggests is a break with - or fall away from - another state. This is often interpreted as a break away from a heightened state of connection and awareness; or, a disconnection from the living truth.

This implies that collective images and myths reappear in our minds, in our histories, as grand archetypes that serve as signifiers to assist humanity in its recollection of lost memories.

Touching upon this, **Carl Gustav Jung** wrote that,

&gt;Our psyche is set up in accord with the structure of the universe, and what happens in the macrocosm likewise happens in the infinitesimal and most subjective reaches of the psyche. 1

Here, Jung is highlighting the distinct correspondence between the human psyche and [it's synchronization](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_synchronicity.htm) with the grander universe of which we are a part.

This emphasizes the notion of the participatory mind, a concept that was known - if not articulated - amongst our pre-modern ancestors.  


It has been suggested by various psychologists that humanity resonates closely with the notion of the 'Fall from Paradise' because we carry within our collective consciousness vestiges of a remembrance. That is, we have a deep intuitive sense that we once belonged to something 'higher,' and to which we may one day return.

It seems that within our interior selves lies the hope of returning to something once 'lost' - a Paradise Lost, or some sacred state of communion.

This idea has been expressed in allegorical form in many tales, such as in this one, 'The Precious Jewel,' adapted from Eastern sources:

In a remote realm of perfection, there was a just monarch who had a wife and a wonderful son and daughter. They all lived together in happiness.

One day the father called his children before him and said:

&gt;'The time has come, as it does for all. You are to go down, an infinite distance, to another land. You shall seek and find and bring back a precious Jewel.'  
The travelers were conducted in disguise to a strange land, whose inhabitants almost all lived a dark existence.  
   
Such was the effect of this place that the two lost touch with each other, wandering as if asleep. From time to time they saw phantoms, similitudes of their country and of the Jewel, but such was their condition that these things only increased the depth of their reveries, which they now began to take as reality.  
   
When news of his children's plight reached the king, he sent word by a trusted servant, a wise man:  
'Remember your mission, awaken from your dream, and remain together.'  
With this message they roused themselves, and with the help of their rescuing guide they dared the monstrous perils which surrounded the Jewel, and by its magic aid returned to their realm of light, there to remain in increased happiness for evermore. 2

This allegory/parable, amongst others similar, reveals that a latent message lays hidden deep within us, and which acts as a chord of remembrance keeping us connected with something 'essential' yet forgotten.  


Mythologists **Joseph Campbell** and **Mircea Eliade** have both shown that one story in particular threads its way through nearly all traditions and myths - the story of a lost idyllic golden age.

This mythical narrative tells of the hero's journey to restore the world to its former glory and high state:

&gt;a tale of loss and the need for heroic restoration.

It is also a journey to reconnect ourselves with a sense of the sacred; to restore the bond with a cosmos that enfolds humanity within a universal sense of meaning, where the human psyche merges into the significant whole.  


Many myths recovered from the past, and from indigenous tribes, reveal a worldview of our ancients that accepted all things as part of a living, conscious, and sacred cosmos.

Within this cosmological view all life was viewed as connected with an animating energy that interweaved throughout.

As mythological researcher **Richard Heinberg** writes:

&gt;I feel compelled toward the view that our cultural memories of a Golden Age of harmony are the residue of a once-universal understanding of the spiritual dimension of human consciousness, and are at the same time memories of how contact with that dimension has been almost completely severed. 3

The contact may appear almost severed, yet traces of it have remained in various traditions, some more obscure than others.

This once bygone state that the stories and myths refer to as the Golden Age - or Paradise - can also be regarded as a metaphor for an evolved state of consciousness as well as a highly evolved state of civilization.

Humankind's state is that of having fallen into the grip of gross matter, and of having left behind a finer awareness of subtle energies. We have, as all major spiritual traditions commonly state, entered into a realm of separation from a divine or sacred source.  


Mircea Eliade, in his [The Sacred and the Profane](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/sacred-profane.pdf), writes that every historical culture regarded the human condition as being under a temporary spell of unnatural limitation and separateness.

Also, that our world now contains symbols and signs that serve to jolt human consciousness into some degree of reawakened awareness and remembrance, such as in the tale of the 'Precious Jewel' told above.

Eliade reminds us that in so-called 'primitive' societies the act of understanding the symbol can help to succeed in 'living the universal.'

Similarly, mythologist Joseph Campbell describes how the aim of ancient spiritual practices, tribal myths, and [shamanic teachings](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_chaman.htm) was to assist in recovering a lost mode of awareness.  


It is easy to conclude that the myth of *Paradise* (or of a *Golden Age*) represents an innate and universal longing, deep within humanity, for a return to a state of tranquility from which we have become separated.

Metaphorically, it may indicate that the inner being of the human, when in its natural and essential state, is in balance and harmony.

Perhaps there have been historical ages in which human beings shared a state of oneness or union with all life and with their environment, and that this peak of civilization was indeed lost.

The [Hopi legend](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_leyenda_hopi.htm) of the 'First People' talks of a time in the ancient past when people,

&gt;'felt as one and understood one another without talking,' as if suggesting a form of collective communion.

This legend describes a time when humans on the planet manifested a form of suprasensory perception, and where dialogue often occurred between various entities.

Anthropologist **Roger Wescott** writes that:

&gt;Moreover, most mythic traditions concur in asserting that, in the Golden Age, human beings associated easily and often with beings that were discarnate or only intermittently incarnate, ranging from awesome cosmic deities to playful local spirits. 4

Eliade, likewise, noted in his research that ancient myths spoke of a *friendship between animals and human*, with even knowledge of their respective languages.  


Eliade speculates that the shamanic imagery and/or visions of human transformation into an animal may be a metaphorical account of re-establishing a connection that was lost 'at the dawn of time.'

According to Eliade, the shaman goes into a transcendental state in order to 'abolish the present human condition,' which is regarded as a resultant state from the 'Fall' - and thus to re-enter into the natural condition of 'primordial man' as it was during the *Golden Age*. 5

Heinberg considers whether:

&gt;…paradise may be seen as serving a specific function, as a design for living embedded in the circuitry of human consciousness. All biological organisms, including human beings, contain elements of design…  
   
Perhaps we also contain within us a neurological or psychic program for the optimal design of social and spiritual relations between ourselves, the Cosmos, and Nature - a design of telepathic oneness and interspecies communion that represents the goal toward which our individual and collective experience would naturally tend to unfold. 6

Heinberg is suggesting here that memories of Paradise/Golden Age may not only, or necessarily, refer to a physical reality or time but serve to activate and catalyze human neurological and psychic functioning into continued evolutionary growth.

The memory, then, is not only as a remembrance of things past (as Proust would say) but may also function as a 'design' wired into us as a social and spiritual guide during dark ages - those times when our psychic, and thus also physical, states are low and separated from a sacred source.  


Similarly, various religious, spiritual, and indigenous traditions all refer to this rupture (our 'Fall') as a descent into greed, egoism, fear, and selfishness.

It is a state where the focus is almost entirely upon gross materialism.

Gnostic, Hindu, and Buddhist traditions also refer to humanity forgetting its true purpose; of how the distraction of, and attraction to, the physical world produces a continued state of separation.

Teutonic Norse myths state that a renewal of the world would only come after great destruction in which a period of chaos and disorder would arise that would see humans commit many degrading and tragic acts.

There are also numerous accounts in ancient and sacred texts that depict the theme of cyclic destruction and renewal, from biblical accounts, Hindu scriptures, and Tibetan narratives.

Our myths, stories, and narratives may serve to remind us of where we have been, and to where we need to return.

Yet can we rely solely on the old myths, or,

&gt;Are we now in need of new mythologies?  
   
After all, where did all the gods go?

&amp;#x200B;

**New Mythologies**  


It has been said that our old gods are dead or dying.

The many gods of times past were abandoned in favor of *the one god concept* with the rise of [monotheistic religions](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/mistic/religionsplanetearth.htm). With this shift away from multiple gods - which played a more direct, intervening role in human affairs - a more individualized sense of self and self-consciousness began to emerge.

The spiritual focus was now not on the interaction with multiple gods but of a relation with a single source that was transcendent and beyond the lowly human. Humanity no longer played ball together with their *godly caretakers*.

The human psyche slowly became separated from a close communion with the gods. This psychic bond, or participation, between cosmic forces and the human soul gradually became severed, leaving the individual more to their own devices and further away from a 'far off' god.  


This break from the interventionist gods is likely to have played a role in the shift of human consciousness more towards its own self-involvement, which amplified the presence and dominance of the ego.

Along with this shift came the art of personal reflection, and the manifestation of individual thinking.

This can be seen in the external transition from ancient Egyptian spiritual traditions to the human philosophy of the Greeks. This marked a shift toward knowledge as grasped by the human mind, and thus led to the increased belief that no gods were needed to understand such lofty concepts.

Divinity, the realm of the gods, became a place to which certain elite human minds could broker access. This was seen as liberating the human soul from the direct and all-powerful influence of the gods in daily life.

A new independence arose within the life of humanity that preceded an era of increasing human autonomy at play within a material world. The human being was now born into an environment where the gods had withdrawn.

Humanity was now left to stand on its own spiritual feet, and to learn to navigate through a world given over to them by their gods. And yet it was precisely this kind of environment which made it possible for an individual human being to develop a sense of full responsibility for their own behavior and spiritual state.

The soul life of the human had now become their own task to contend with, and could no longer be seen as under the sway of external transcendental forces.

Although this shift placed the onus of development upon the human self, it also dissolved the reciprocal understanding between human and cosmos.  


By defining ourselves *independent of the gods* we also defined ourselves as similarly being separated from Nature.

This process of separation between our interior and exterior lives was drawn out over centuries, and further exacerbated through orthodox religious thinking, scientific rationalism, Cartesian philosophy, and attitudes to the human body.

We are now coming to the end of the influence of the [Greco-Roman/Judeo-Christian era](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_biblianazar.htm).

As philosopher **Jeremy Naydler** notes:

&gt;It has achieved its purpose, which was to make us more individuated, more self- rather than god-centered in our soul-life, and thus more free.  
   
But now there is a need to become aware again of inner, spiritual realities, but to become aware of them grounded in our own sense of self and with a clear and discriminating intelligence with which we can once more turn toward them. 7

Individual selfhood came at a great cost.

In fact, it could only come about when the previous gods had faded from human consciousness. And yet from this came the emergence of [self-consciousness](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_consciousuniverse.htm), the focus on individual selfhood, and the possibility for self-transcendence through individual inner work. That is, to take the path back toward a cosmic, sacred communion through self-volition and individual choice.

This path *back to the gods* (the sacred source) does not imply 'going out' there - to reach them in some realm beyond - but rather suggests allowing them back into the human psyche.

This means receiving the sacred connection once again within the inner life/self of the human. We could phrase it as bringing the sacred impulse back down into material life - the re-sacralization of the material plane.

It could be said that human destiny is to *know the infinite without leaving the finite* \- both exist simultaneously and both are necessary.  


Spirit is not recognized by it being something other than the material, but by overcoming its otherness. It is implicit within all material forms, and is in communion with all entities. In the sacred traditions spirit is a living recognition, not an inanimate one. That is, sacred spirit wishes to be known beyond its otherness.

Our multiple gods, as depth psychology informs us, also represent aspects of the human psyche.

Astrology places a similar pattern upon the planets, as their alignment influences psychic correspondences and can affect the human physically, mentally, and emotionally. In some of the most ancient spiritual traditions that came out of [Egypt](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_egipto.htm) and [Mesopotamia](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sumer_annunaki.htm) thousands of years ago, the realm of Spirit existed in a transcendental pure form beyond matter.

It was human destiny for the privileged capable few to ascend through rigorous trial and initiation toward this otherworld and seek a connection with it so that it may manifest through them upon the material plane.

Hence such cultures were star-orientated as this represented a source beyond the terrestrial earth. In more modern times, the implication has shifted to a view that sees Spirit as having its destiny to become implicated in matter.

Together, spirit and matter form the necessary communion.

The re-spiritualization - the re-sacralization - of the material world must come about through humanity's involvement. The human must embrace the cosmos within themselves, and to bring it 'down to earth,' so to speak.

This is now a mass endeavor, which suggests that the time for the elite special few initiates is over. In other words, where once a 'higher' state of consciousness was first developed through exceptional individuals, it is now to be developed through the mass by receptive individuals and communities connecting together across physical and temporal boundaries.  


A re-sacralization is required on a global scale - a sacred revival for our times - this very thing may be brought into play within our global civilization if we transition to a genuine relationship with our developing technologies.

Likewise, the natural world is not an obstacle that needs to be overcome if we are to strive towards a sacred communion and understanding.

On the contrary, the natural world is itself the playground upon which sacred energies move through, and within which lies the soul of the world. The old mythologies placed the gods within the supernatural world, where Nature was something to move through and beyond. Yet the old mythologies are no longer with us for they no longer serve the same purpose.

They too have been transcended for we are in a different era - an altogether different temporal and spatial state.

The old mythological world of archetypal energies has now been fused into an order where the supernatural, the natural, and the human mind-soul merge together.

We are participating in bringing the sacred back into the material realm - in bringing the gods back home!

The sacred source is to be encountered through ourselves and not within another world; through normal human consciousness rather than its denial.

We can say that,

&gt;'humanity has entered a new stage in the unfolding cosmological drama, and that this stage is to do with the infinite rediscovering itself within the sphere of the finite.' 8

From these ashes a new mythology must arise, one that has been gestating within the inner reaches of humankind for some time already.

It has been suggested that we are in a battle for the Western soul, as we have been largely sleeping through crisis after crisis of the spirit. A new mythology is rapidly becoming both a social and spiritual necessity, as our old frameworks and worldviews dissolve from usefulness.

Mythologies have the power to conduct and guide us through our lifetimes, as a companion upon the psycho-spiritual journey of transformation.

A mythology is a set of figures and symbols that can reflect and shape a state of mind; they can serve as a perceptual framework. They can be our filters and our friends, but they neither belong to us nor any particular locale.

They are available for everyone, and are beyond the individual mind.

According to **Joseph Campbell**, arguably one of the most respected mythologists of the 20th century,

&gt;The life of a mythology derives from the vitality of its symbols as metaphors delivering, not simply the idea, but a sense of actual participation in such a realization of transcendence, infinity, and abundance…  
   
The first and most essential service of a mythology is this one, of opening the mind and heart to the utter wonder of all being, and the second service, then, is cosmological:  
of representing the universe and whole spectacle of nature, both as known to the mind and as beheld by the eye…9

Mythology then should serve to assist participation in our own transcendence amid the spectacle of the cosmos.

Unfortunately, it is when mythologies become locked-in as social, political, and [religious control systems](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/mistic/religionsplanetearth.htm) that the human developmental path becomes distorted and muddy underfoot.  


Myths emphasize commonality and offer us a transcendental communion, if we don't corrupt them into further mental prisons.

It is essential therefore that the new mythologies for a sacred revival inspire within humanity a wish for interiorizing the cosmological impulse that is pervasive and which irradiates our reality.

It's all a lie.

History is being rewritten daily thanks to alternative media news sources bringing to light the mass propaganda of false history and disclosing truths hidden for decades and centuries.

My son's 3rd grade class was discussing [**Columbus**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_colon.htm) in class this week. I pick him up each day to ""deprogram"" him from the public indoctrination system. When I asked him what he had learned about Mr. Columbus, he said that school taught that one of his ships had sunk off an island.

I said, ""that's it?"" and he said ""yes"".

I then looked at his homework and it included the Scholastic magazine which featured Columbus and sure enough, the article only said he had made it only to an island name Haiti. Over a dozen states no longer recognize Columbus Day, a creation of the Knights of Columbus back in 1934.

Even edgy [Mainstream whorporate news](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_mediacontrol.htm) is revising history now as truths become known as to the barbaric history of our country's ""founding"" when we genocided *over 97% of the Indian population* in conquest and brought millions of slaves across the Atlantic to work in the cotton and tobacco fields of the wealthy with names like Jefferson, Washington, Adams, etc.

This is 24/7 Wall St.'s list of the richest U.S. presidents:

&gt;**George Washington**, first president from 1789 to 1797  
 \- Net worth: $525 million In office  
His Virginia plantation, Mount Vernon, consisted of five separate farms on 8,000 acres of prime farmland, run by more than 300 slaves. His wife, Martha Washington, inherited significant property from her father. Washington made well more than subsequent presidents: his salary was 2% of the total U.S. budget in 1789.  
   
**Thomas Jefferson**, third president from 1801 to 1809  
 \- Net worth: $212 million  
Jefferson was left 3,000 acres and several dozen slaves by his father. Monticello, his home on a 5,000-acre plantation in Virginia, was one of the architectural wonders of its time. He made considerable money in various political positions before becoming president, but was mired in debt towards the end of his life.  
   
**James Madison**, fourth president from 1809 to 1817  
 \- Net worth: $101 million  
Madison was the largest landowner in Orange County, Va. His land holding consisted of 5,000 acres and the Montpelier estate. He made significant wealth as Secretary of State and president. Madison lost money at the end of his life due to the steady financial collapse of his plantation.Additionally, all these men had slaves, even until death. In fact, Thomas Jefferson pledged his slaves as assets upon his death against the massive debt he had incurred. ([source](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/02/16/richest-usa-presidents/1923739/))

Now these richest of the new country land baron's of the time were really interested in freedom for all of We the People as they pushed natives into reservations on the worst land possible and took slaves willingly to run their business'?

When they were done with the ""most important document in history"", the U.S. Constitution, they gave rights to only 7% of the population; White, Male and Puritan land owners. It took 75 years later for minorities to even get the right to vote and 120 years for women and now corporations of the wealthy run this country.

The truth is the barbaric ways of old Europe just morphed into new overlords who broke away from the King and Church to form their own Kingdoms and used deception and fraud to sell it to the masses.

My country 'tis of thee…

It may sound a little over the top but it's really no overstatement to say that much in our modern world is based on falsehood and fabrication.

We are told, for example, that Columbus 'discovered' America in 1492, yet there is plenty of evidence to suggest that others had visited America before Columbus:

&gt;including visitors from ancient Egypt, Phoenicia and medieval Europe.

Despite this modern authorities continue to push the line that ""Columbus discovered America.""

In point of fact *Columbus* *himself never even set eyes upon America*; the closest he got to the mainland of North America was Puerto Rico. However in the aftermath of Columbus's voyage John Cabot sailed from Bristol, England, which in turn opened the way for the first colony in Jamestown, Virginia and thus allowed the English to claim America as their own.

Yet there is considerable evidence that suggests that others from different cultures preceded Cabot and Columbus.

So one is forced to ask:

&gt;Why, when there is much to suggest that others from different cultures preceded Columbus, don't we hear more about this possibility being investigated?  
Could it be that certain powers have a vested interest in keeping our real history under wraps?

Whatever the answer the fact remains that a great deal has been unearthed which is completely at odds with conventional notions regarding the origins of what we know today as America.

In fact according to some contemporary authorities, the Native Americans encountered by the early settlers from England were not what they appeared to be.

They were indeed native to the Americas but they were not its original inhabitants, who according to various tribal legends, had disappeared eons before in a series of cataclysms.

**Columbus** **Day? True Legacy - Cruelty and Slavery**

Once again, it's time to celebrate Columbus Day. Yet, the stunning truth is: If [Christopher Columbus](http://www.creators.com/liberal/norman-solomon.html) were alive today, he would be put on trial for crimes against humanity.

[Columbus' reign of terror](http://hubpages.com/hub/Christopher-Columbus), as documented by noted historians, was so bloody, his [legacy so unspeakably cruel](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/History/Hero-making_LMTTM.html), that Columbus makes a modern villain like Saddam Hussein look like a pale codfish.

Question: Why do we honor a man who, if he were alive today, would almost certainly be sitting on Death Row awaiting execution?

If you'd like to know [the true story](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7D91031F937A35752C1A96F948260) about Christopher Columbus, please read on. But I warn you, it's not for the faint of heart.

Here's the basics. On the second Monday in October each year, we celebrate Columbus Day (this year, it's on October 11th). We teach our school kids a cute little song that goes: ""In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue."" It's an American tradition, as American as pizza pie. Or is it? Surprisingly, the true story of Christopher Columbus has very little in common with the myth we all learned in school.

[Columbus Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_day), as we know it in the United States, was invented by the [Knights of Columbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_day#United_States_observance), a Catholic fraternal service organization. Back in the 1930s, they were looking for a Catholic hero as a role-model their kids could look up to. In 1934, as a result of lobbying by the Knights of Columbus, Congress and President Franklin Roosevelt signed Columbus Day into law as a federal holiday to honor this courageous explorer.

Or so we thought...

There are several problems with this. First of all, Columbus wasn't the first European to discover America. As we all know, the Viking, [Leif Ericson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lief_Erikson) probably founded a Norse village on Newfoundland some 500 years earlier. So, hat's off to Leif.

But if you think about it, the whole concept of discovering America is, well, arrogant.

After all, the Native Americans discovered North America about 14,000 years before Columbus was even born! Surprisingly, DNA evidence now suggests that courageous [Polynesian adventurers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1965514/) sailed dugout canoes across the Pacific and settled in South America long before the Vikings.

Second, [Columbus wasn't a hero](http://www.nativeamericannetroots.net/diary/177/). When he set foot on that sandy beach in the Bahamas on October 12, 1492, Columbus discovered that the islands were inhabited by friendly, peaceful people called the Lucayans, Taínos and Arawaks. Writing in his diary, Columbus said they were a handsome, smart and kind people.

He noted that the gentle Arawaks were [remarkable for their hospitality](http://books.google.com/books?id=P8V7J5qm5-YC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).

&gt;""They offered to share with anyone and when you ask for something, they never say no,"" he said.

The [Arawaks had no weapons](http://socyberty.com/history/genocide-of-christopher-columbus/); their society had neither criminals, prisons nor prisoners. They were so kind-hearted that Columbus noted in his diary that on the day the Santa Maria was shipwrecked, the Arawaks labored for hours to save his crew and cargo.

The native people were so honest that not one thing was missing.

Columbus was so impressed with the hard work of these gentle islanders, that he immediately seized their land for Spain and enslaved them to work in his brutal gold mines. Within only two years, 125,000 (half of the population) of the original natives on the island were dead.

Shockingly, Columbus supervised the selling of native girls into [sexual slavery](http://www.danielnpaul.com/ChristopherColumbus.html). Young girls of the ages 9 to 10 were the most desired by his men. In 1500, Columbus casually wrote about it in his log.

He said:

&gt;""A hundred castellanoes are as easily obtained for a woman as for a farm, and it is very general and there are plenty of dealers who go about [looking for girls](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/History/Hero-making_LMTTM.html); those [from nine to ten are now in demand](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/History/Hero-making_LMTTM.html).""

He forced these peaceful natives work in his gold mines until they died of exhaustion.

If an ""Indian"" worker did not deliver his full quota of gold dust by Columbus' deadline, soldiers would [cut off the man's hands](http://www.criticalthink.info/Phil1301/lieshist.htm) and tie them around his neck to send a message. Slavery was so intolerable for these sweet, gentle island people that at one point, 100 of them committed [mass suicide](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Zinn/Columbus_PeoplesHx.html).

Catholic law forbade the enslavement of Christians, but Columbus solved this problem. He simply refused to baptize the native people of Hispaniola.

On his second trip to the New World, Columbus brought [cannons and attack dogs](http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/40/183.html). If a native resisted slavery, he would cut off a nose or an ear. If slaves tried to escape, Columbus had them burned alive. Other times, he sent attack dogs to hunt them down, and the [dogs would tear off the arms and legs](http://www.criticalthink.info/Phil1301/lieshist.htm) of the screaming natives while they were still alive.

If the Spaniards ran short of meat to feed the dogs, Arawak babies were [killed for dog food](http://www.unitednativeamerica.com/issues/statue.html).

Columbus' acts of cruelty were so unspeakable and so legendary - even in his own day - that Governor [**Francisco De Bobadilla** arrested Columbus ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus#Governorship_and_arrest)and his two brothers, slapped them into chains, and shipped them off to Spain to answer for their crimes against the Arawaks.

But the King and Queen of Spain, their treasury filling up with gold, pardoned Columbus and let him go free.

**Christopher** **Columbus' Crimes Against Humanity**

[**Source**](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/10/5/172256/007/64/394526)

To be sure, the real annihilations did not start until the beginning of Columbus' second voyage to the Americas in 1493 (1).

For while he had expressed admiration for the overall generosity of Indigenous People and considered the Tainos to be ""Very handsome, gentle, and friendly,"" he interpreted all these positive traits as signs of weakness and vulnerability, saying,

&gt;""if devout religious persons knew the Indian Language well, all these people would soon become Christians.""

As a consequence, he kidnapped some of the Tainos and took them back to Spain.

&gt;On his second voyage, in December 1494, Columbus captured 1,500 Tainos on the island of Hispaniola and herded them to Isabela, where 550 of ""the best males and females"" were forced aboard ships bound for the slave markets of Seville.  
   
Under Columbus's leadership, the Spanish attacked the Taino, sparing neither men, women nor children. Warfare, forced labor, starvation and disease reduced Hispaniola's Taino population (estimated at one million to two million in 1492) to extinction within 30 years.

[Furthermore, Columbus wrote a letter to the Spanish governor of the island, Hispaniola](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0161-2492%28199221%2915%3A2%3C321%3AJF%3E2.0.CO%3B2-V&amp;size=LARGE&amp;origin=JSTOR-enlargePage), Columbus asked the governor the cut off the ears and the noses of any of the slaves who resisted being subjugated to slavery.

&gt;…It is estimated that 100 million Indians from the Caribbean, Central, South, and North America perished at the hands of the European invaders. Sadly, unbelievably, really, much of that wholesale destruction was sanctioned and carried out by the Roman Catholic Church and various Protestant denominations. (1: p.37)

One of Columbus' men, [**Bartolome De Las Casas**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas), was so mortified by Columbus' brutal atrocities against the native peoples, that he quit working for Columbus and became a Catholic priest.

He described how the Spaniards under Columbus' command cut off the legs of children who ran from them, to test the sharpness of their blades.

According to De Las Casas, [the men made bets](http://www.mit.edu/~thistle/v9/9.11/1columbus.html) as to who, with one sweep of his sword, could cut a person in half. He says that Columbus' men poured people full of boiling soap.

In a single day, De Las Casas was an eye witness as the Spanish soldiers dismembered, beheaded, or raped 3000 native people.

&gt;""Such inhumanities and barbarisms were committed in my sight as no age can parallel,"" De Las Casas wrote. ""My eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature that now [I tremble as I write](http://www.creators.com/liberal/norman-solomon.html).""

De Las Casas spent the rest of his life trying to protect the helpless native people.

But after a while, there were no more natives to protect. Experts generally agree that before 1492, the population on the island of Hispaniola probably numbered above [3 million](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno_people#Population_decline). Within 20 years of Spanish arrival, it was reduced to only 60,000.

Within 50 years, [not a single original native inhabitant could be found](http://www.glencoe.com/sec/socialstudies/btt/columbus/native_peoples.shtml).

Columbus Day Poem Taught to U.S. School Children

&amp;#x200B;

|| In fourteen hundred ninety-twoColumbus sailed the ocean blue. ||
|:-|:-|:-|
|| He had three ships and left from Spain;He sailed through sunshine, wind and rain.||
|| He sailed by night; he sailed by day;He used the stars to find his way. ||
|| A compass also helped him knowHow to find the way to go. ||
||Ninety sailors were on board; Some men worked while others snored.||
|| Then the workers went to sleep;And others watched the ocean deep.||
|| Day after day they looked for land;They dreamed of trees and rocks and sand. ||
|| October 12 their dream came true,You never saw a happier crew !||
|| ""Indians! Indians!"" Columbus cried;His heart was filled with joyful pride ||
|| But ""India"" the land was not;It was the Bahamas, and it was hot .||
|| The Arakawa natives were very nice;They gave the sailors food and spice.||
|| Columbus sailed on to find some goldTo bring back home, as he'd been told. ||
|| He made the trip again and again,Trading gold to bring to Spain. ||
|| The first American? No, not quite.But Columbus was brave, and he was bright. ||

### Conventional History

Columbus Day first became an official state holiday in Colorado in 1906, and became a [federal holiday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States) in the United States in 1937, though people have celebrated Columbus' voyage since the colonial period.

In 1792, New York City and other U.S. cities celebrated the 300th anniversary of his landing in the New World.

President [**Benjamin Harrison**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison) called upon the people of the United States to celebrate Columbus Day on the 400th anniversary of the event. During the four hundredth anniversary in 1892, teachers, preachers, poets and politicians used Columbus Day rituals to teach ideals of patriotism. These *patriotic* rituals were framed around themes such as support for war, citizenship boundaries, the importance of loyalty to the nation, and celebrating social progress.

[Catholic immigration in the mid-19th century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_the_United_States#19th_century) induced discrimination from anti-immigrant activists.

Like many other immigrant communities, Catholics developed organizations to fight discrimination and provide insurance for the struggling immigrants. One such organization, the [Knights of Columbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_Columbus), chose that name in part because it saw Christopher Columbus as a fitting symbol of Catholic immigrants' right to citizenship: one of their own, a fellow Catholic, had discovered America.

Many [Italian-Americans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian-Americans) observe Columbus Day as a celebration of their heritage, the first occasion being in New York City on October 12, 1866.

Columbus Day was first popularized as a holiday in the United States through the lobbying of Angelo Noce, a first generation Italian, in Denver. The first official, regular Columbus Day holiday was proclaimed by Colorado governor Jesse F. McDonald in 1905 and made a statutory holiday in 1907.

In April 1934, as a result of lobbying by the Knights of Columbus, Congress and President [Franklin Delano Roosevelt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt) made October 12 a [federal holiday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holiday) under the name Columbus Day.

&gt;A Significant movement is spreading to rename this day 'Indigenous People's Day'. It could/would begin the healing to right the wrongs done to so many by the Conquistador's of white European Man, of which most are of our ancestral heritages.**Petition** [**here**](http://www.petitiononline.com/indian/petition.html)

Indigenous Natives lived with the land, air and waterways for thousands and thousands of years and never thought to own or despoil their Mother's and Father's who gave Life to all.

 Today, we are losing 200 species a day, globally, many waterways in the U.S., like the Navarro River where I live, no longer have salmon and trout come up the river or like the halibut, snapper, rock fish, salmon, etc. that are fished out along the West Coast.

What a huge step it would be for this country if we could begin to ask forgiveness, make reparations and put these proud Natives in places of leadership to teach us how to be good stewards and hold deep reverence and respect for Nature so that she may heal and provide for the next seven generations to come.

RECONSIDER COLUMBUS DAY AD

Columbus Day, a day that our government has deemed worthy of remembrance.

But with all due respect - with all due respect - with all due respect, there's an ugly truth that has been overlooked for way too long. Columbus committed heinous crimes against the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean and millions of natives throughout the Americas.

And Columbus set the stage for the slave trade in the New World. So, please, please reconsider if this is a man you want to honor. Reconsider if you want to celebrate the crimes of Columbus. It's not your fault; it happened a long time ago.

But remaining neutral and pretending like it didn't happen, or that it doesn't still impact us today?

So, please, take the day to learn the whole story: [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il5hwpdJMcg)

For christsakes, the guy C.C. thought he was in INDIA or so the story goes!

He then found the indigenous people so giving, he went back to get 14 more galleon ships to steal, pillage, rape and conquer the peaceful people throughout the Caribbean, South and North America's. For an excellent overview of the plight of the 'loser's' to American hegemony over the centuries read Howard Zinn's [A People's History of The United States](http://www.amazon.com/A-Peoples-History-United-States/dp/0060838655/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8), as told by those that suffered at the hands of the invaders.)

As the nation commemorates the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the so-called ""New World"" in 1492, indigenous activists at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado, are pushing for schools to teach the ""real history of the Americas"" and to celebrate indigenous culture.

""Columbus Day"" has long evoked sadness and anger amongst people of color, especially Native Americans, who object to honoring a man who opened the door to European colonization, the exploitation of native peoples, and the slave trade.

&gt;""The official story that Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas is ludicrous.  
   
A few miles from Edinburgh in Scotland today still stands Rosslyn Chapel, that holy grail of the Brotherhood Elite. It was built in the shape of a Templar cross by the St Clair-Sinclair family and is a mass of esoteric symbolism.  
   
The foundations were laid in 1446 and it was completed in the 1480s. How remarkable then that the stonework at Rosslyn includes depictions of sweetcorn and cacti which were only found in America and Christopher Columbus did not 'discover' that continent until 1492! How could this be? There is, in fact, no mystery. Christopher Columbus was not even nearly the first white person to land in the Americas.  
   
The Phoenicians, Norse, Irish, Welsh, Bretons, Basques and Portuguese, all sailed to America before him and so did Prince Henry Sinclair of Rosslyn, as documented in a rare book by Frederick I. Pohl called Prince Henry Sinclair's Voyage To The New World 1398.  
   
Sinclair made the journey with another Brotherhood bloodline, the Zeno family, one of the most prominent [Black Nobility families](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_blacknobil.htm) in Venice. Sinclair and Antonio Zeno landed in what we call Newfoundland and went ashore in Nova Scotia (New Scotland) in 1398…  
   
The Brotherhood had known about the Americas for thousands of years and Christopher Columbus was used to make the official discovery so that the occupation of the Americas could begin.""  
**David Icke, ""The Biggest Secret"" 178-9**

Columbus' supporters were European royalty and [the Templars](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_masonsknightstemplar.htm).

His father-in-law was a former Templar Knight and Catherine de Medici of the Illuminati bloodline (along with others) financed his voyage. Columbus' three ships sailed under the Templars Red Cross flag, used today by the Red Cross and Switzerland.

The royals also sent out fleets of conquistadors and swash-buckling pirates flying [the Skull and Bones](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_skullbones.htm) flag - their orders to rape, kill, and pillage all they could from the New World.

&gt;""The Skull and Bones cross used by the secret society comes from the pirate skull and cross bones.

**A Little Matter of Genocide - Ward Churchill**

[**Source**](http://www.monabaker.com/pMachine/more.php?id=A2068_0_1_0_M)

During the four centuries spanning the time between 1492, when Christopher Columbus first set foot on the 'New World' of a Caribbean beach and 1892, when the US Census Bureau concluded that there were fewer than a quarter-million indigenous people surviving within the country's boundaries, *a hemispheric population estimated to have been as great as 125 million was reduced by something over 90 percent*.

The people had died in their millions of being hacked apart with axes and swords, buried alive and trampled under horses, hunted as game and fed to dogs, shot, beaten, stabbed, scalped for bounty, hanged on meat-hooks and thrown over the sides of ships at sea, worked to death as slave laborers, intentionally starved and frozen to death during a multitude of forced marches and internments, and, in an unknown number of instances, deliberately infected with epidemic diseases. (p. 1)

Later in the book he gives a staggering estimate of the total who were 'ethnically cleansed':

&gt;'All told, it is probable that more than one hundred million native people were 'eliminated' in the course of Europe's ongoing 'civilization' of the western hemisphere.' (p. 86)

Although Ward Churchill has not written fully on the genocide against the Palestinians, he does place it within the global context of the present book, A Little Matter of Genocide, a book which leapt out at me from a display of books by and about native Americans in City Lights Book Store.

The author is an enrolled Keetoowah Cherokee and Professor of American Indian Studies in the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder and has been a leader of the Colorado Chapter of the American Indian Movement since 1972.

The title of the book is taken from a statement by **Russell Means**, founder of the American Indian Movement, who spoke of 'a little matter of genocide right here at home,' by which he meant the ongoing genocide against the American Indians which is still in progress.

**A Little Matter of Genocide**

The U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Comes Clean 185 years later

[**Source**](http://www.russellmeansfreedom.com/2009/bia-head-admits-to-american-indian-genocide/)

&gt;""Immediately upon its establishment in 1824, the Office of Indian Affairs was an instrument by which the United States enforced its ambition against the Indian nations. As the nation expanded West, the agency participated in the ethnic cleansing that befell the western tribes.  
   
War begets tragedy, but the deliberate spread of disease, the decimation of the bison herds, the use of alcohol to destroy mind and body, and the cowardly killing of women and children made for tragedy on a scale so ghastly that it cannot be dismissed as merely the inevitable consequence of the clash of competing ways of life.  
   
After the devastation of tribal economies, the BIA set out to destroy all things Indian by forbidding the speaking of Indian languages, prohibiting traditional religious activities, outlawing traditional government, and making Indians ashamed of who they were.  
   
Worst of all, the BIA committed these acts against the children entrusted to its boarding schools.  
   
The trauma of shame, fear, and anger has passed from one generation to the next, and manifests itself in the rampant alcoholism, drug abuse, and domestic violence that plague Indian country.  
   
The BIA expresses its profound sorrow for these wrongs, extends this formal apology to Indian people for its historical conduct, and makes promises for its future conduct.""

**The Canary Effect**

*The Canary Effect* is a 2006 documentary that looks into the effects of that the United States and its policies have on the Indigenous peoples (Native Americans) who are residents.

It premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and won the Stanley Kubrick Award at the 2006 Traverse City Film Festival (Michael Moore hosts).

The movie was directed by **Robin Davey** and **Yellow Thunder Woman**, who are both members of LA Based alternative pop group *The Bastard Fairies*.

Delving deeply into the often misunderstood and frequently over looked historic realities of the American Indian, *The Canary Effect* follows the terrifying and horrific abuses instilled upon the Indigenous people of North America, and details the genocidal practices of the US government and its continuing affects on present day Indian country.

Featuring interviews with the leading scholars and experts on Indian issues including controversial author Ward Churchill, the film brings together the past and present in a way never before captured so eloquently and boldly on film.

**DENNIS BANKS:** I was in the boarding schools when punishment was very severe if you ran away.

This was during the early '40s. I was taken to a boarding school when I was four years old, and taken away from my mother and my father, my grandparents, who I stayed with most of the time, and just abruptly taken away and then put into the boarding school, 300 miles away from our home.

And, you know, the beatings began immediately, the - almost the de-Indianizing program. It was a terrible experience that the American government was experimenting with. And that was trying to destroy the culture and the person, destroy the Indian-ness in him and save the human being, save the - kill an Indian, save the man.

That was, you know, the description of what this policy is about, about trying to -

**AMY GOODMAN:** Now, the government ran the schools?

**DENNIS BANKS:** The U.S. government paid - of course, they ran a lot of the schools themselves, but they also delegated a lot of it to the Christians, Christian communities.

The Catholics had some. The Episcopalians had some. The Lutherans had some. Methodists had some. And so, it was like a complicit - there was complicity between the churches and the state in taking care of Indian problem, solving the Indian problem, and trying to change who we were.

**AMY GOODMAN:** Dennis, where had - where had you lived? Where had you lived, and where were you brought to school?

**DENNIS BANKS:** I lived on the federal - or, on the Leech Lake Indian Reservation, where I was born, in northern Minnesota. And I was taken to a boarding school 300 miles away to the south, southernmost part of Minnesota, the southwestern part, called Pipestone Indian School. I stayed there three years - six years -

**AMY GOODMAN:** And how -

**DENNIS BANKS:** Go ahead.

**AMY GOODMAN:** How did you communicate with your family? And how often did you get to see them? Did you get to talk to them?

**DENNIS BANKS:** Never. Never.

You know, they cut off all communication with your parents, and a lot of letters, which I found later in - I stayed there for six years without communicating to - with my parents at all. And finally, they let us go home for six years. Of course, we couldn't speak the language. We could speak only English and - what these young people were talking about.

But there was severe punishment for running away from that kind of system. I ran away. I kept running away. Almost once a week, I'd run away from those schools. They'd catch me. They'd bring me back to the school, beat me. And it was - it was terrible.

I mean, there was other kinds of punishment that we went through, as well. And it was - now that, it was a - that kind of experience, I still remember what it is like today. And I have a friend who has been - who had been my friend for over 70 years now, and we remember those days.

There were - we stuck together. A lot of people stuck together. Just being together, that's what saved a lot of us from terrible consequences of speaking. But eventually, they - you know, they kept beating me down, and I kept - so I started learning English, and I started learning who the presidents were. I started learning all that stuff.

And then they let me go home for 30 days. Six years. And I asked my mother, I said, ""Why didn't you write to me?"" And she - you know, and she says, ""I did."" But I never - I never questioned beyond that. And then there was - they sent me to another boarding school in North Dakota, another 200 miles away. I was there for three years.

And then, after that, same thing: no - only English, you know, corporal punishment. And then I went home for another 30 days, asked my mother, ""Why is it you didn't write to me again?"" She says, ""I did, and I did.""

Then they sent me to another boarding school in South Dakota further away, so another 400 miles. I kept running away from these schools. And I finally ran away from the last one, and I finally made it home.

And it wasn't 'til almost just three years ago when my daughter was - they were doing a documentary on Dennis Banks, and they found - they went to - in the federal depository records in Kansas City.

And she called me, and she says, ""Dad, we found"" - ""Dad,"" she said, ""we found your - we found your school records."" And I said, ""Bring them back."" So she brought them back, and I started looking at them. And she says, ""Dad, we also found something else.""

She handed me a shoebox. And I opened up the shoebox, and those were letters, letters from my mother. And I started opening them up, and I started reading them.

And in the second one, there was a letter to the superintendent of the school that said,

&gt;""Here is $5. Please send my children - my son back home to me.""

Post your best conspiracy theories. Here’s mine:

In 2015 there was a test done at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. It was headed by Ralph Baric.

https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/lab-made-coronavirus-triggers-debate-34502

The purpose of the lab test was to manipulate a bat coronavirus to see if it could infect humans. It was discovered that it could.

https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985

One of the people who co wrote the paper was a Chinese researcher by the name of Xing-Ye Gi. Google scholar shows Gi has written or co-written numerous papers on SARS, ebola and coronavirus.

https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=%22Xing-Yi+Ge%22&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_allsubj=all&amp;hl=en

Gi works in Wuhan, within the sole BSL-4 lab in the entire country. A Chinese national literally worked on modifying a bat coronavirus to infect humans, 100% confirmed. Hmm...

There are only 70 BSL-4 (Highest Level Biosafety research labs) in the world, and in China, a country of 1.4 Billion people, only 1 exists. Coincidentally, it happens to be in Wuhan. The people in Wuhan aren’t the only Chinese eating stuff like bat soup, this would have to be a pretty crazy coincidence since there are at least 9 cities larger than Wuhan and it could have appeared in any one of them, but it just happened to appear next to the sole bioweapon lab in the entire country.

https://www.nature.com/news/inside-the-chinese-lab-poised-to-study-world-s-most-dangerous-pathogens-1.21487

This article was written in 2017 about its construction, and was worried about the potential safety since this is China’s first attempt at such a lab, and it wasn’t receiving guidance from the rest of the world on its construction. The article also mentions one of the first viruses it will be working on is SARS. The Coronavirus is closely related to SARs from initial inspection. The article warned that this lab would likely be dual use, as China claims it only exists to help research and cure disease when in reality China also wants to get in the Bioweapon game with the other superpowers.

A Bioweapon escaping such a lab isn’t impossible, as Anthrax escaped a Soviet bioweapon lab in 1979 killing at least 100 people, but the true number is unknown as they denied it happened at all for more than a decade. Soviets lied saying it was due to tainted meat, and the KGB destroyed all hospital records and other evidence. They were extremely lucky with which way the wind was blowing, as if it blew the other way spores would have landed in a nearby city killing hundreds of thousands of people. Boris Yeltsin eventually admitted to the truth of this Biological Chernobyl.

SARS even escaped a Beijing lab twice!

Laboratory safety at the Chinese Institute of Virology under close scrutiny
Apr 26, 2004
The latest outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China, with eight confirmed or suspected cases so far and hundreds quarantined, involves two researchers who were working with the virus in a Beijing research lab, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday (April 26).
“We suspect two people, a 26-year-old female postgraduate student and a 31-year-old male postdoc, were both infected, apparently in two separate incidents,” Bob Dietz, WHO spokesman in Beijing, told The Scientist.
The woman was admitted to hospital on April 4, but the man apparently became infected independently 2 weeks later, being hospitalized on April 17. Both worked at the Chinese Institute of Virology in Beijing, part of China's Center for Disease Control.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2004/07/sars-crisis-topples-china-lab-chief

Now to speculate. I don’t think it is a completed bioweapon as China would likely have a vaccine ready for it to protect their people after deployment against an enemy, and it would likely be far more dangerous. Much more likely is that is an only partially complete bioweapon, a chimera SARS with aspects of other viruses thrown in as they experiment with creating the final product. This is what leaked. Since it is only an early prototype, there is no vaccine ready yet, and it will still be far more dangerous than a natural virus. This is also a huge reason for the coverup. If it gets out that China let a bioweapon escape, there will be an international shitshow. Unlike what other conspiracy theorists have speculated, I find it extremely doubtful that a bioweapon was released deliberately, as there is no believeable motive and this will inflict terrible damage on China economically.

This may not be just a tragic accident.

*For ex-pot kingpin, new trouble—health supplements*

“Jared Wheat has been on the government’s radar for more than two decades. Twenty years ago, he was convicted as a drug smuggler who operated a massive marijuana ring in the South. Now, Wheat must pay a $40 million judgment and recall health supplements that a judge says falsely claim to burn fat and cure erectile dysfunction.”

“Amazingly while he’s in jail, he decides he needs to make more money, sell more product,” Jim Kohm, associate director of the Enforcement Division at the FTC, told CNBC. ”He was calling the shots for the whole thing and he was doing so in jail.”

“In a plea bargain, the defendants admitted to operating a manufacturing facility in Belize that made generic versions of such pharmaceuticals as Xanax, Valium, Ambien, Vioxx, Zoloft, Viagra and Cialis and selling them over the Internet without requiring prescriptions.”

“The plea bargain recommended that Wheat receive a prison sentence of 37 months, but Judge Camp rejected that at a sentencing hearing last month, saying it was not severe enough for “the seriousness of the conduct.""

“The judge previously sentenced Hi-Tech officials Stephen D. Smith and Tomasz Holda to serve 27 months and 16 1/2 months, respectively. Holda’s sentence will be served consecutively with time he is now serving for a federal firearms offense.”

“Under a plea deal, three other defendants were sentenced to jail terms of 16 to 27 months; the judge found the 37 months for Wheat suggested in the plea was not harsh enough for his actions. During plea negotiations, prosecutors dropped allegations of racketeering, spiking supplements with ephedrine alkaloids and conspiracies of blackmail and murder.”

However I'm wondering if the arguments for gay marriage can be used to support other questionable romantic/sexual relationships such as incest or bestiality.  Take the phrase, ""love is love.""  That means anybody should be able to love whomever they want.  Is the government allowed to tell us who or who not to have sexual relations with?  For example, many years ago, we had the same reaction to gay marriage as we did to ""unusual relationships"" like mentioned before.  On a legal standpoint, I understand why bestiality and pedophilia are illegal, as one of the parties are unable to give consent.  But what about incest?  In this situation, both parties are able to give consent.  From what I understand, incest results to higher rates of genetic diseases and disabilities in children - especially brother/sister relationships - which is the only reason I can think of why it is illegal.  What if the factor of procreating are out of the equation - both parties are in a situation where neither want or in risk of having children, eliminating inbred children?  In this case the only argument against incest is that it's morally wrong in the eyes of the general public.  Do you think such relationships could be legalized in the future?  Consider that only decades ago, the general consensus was that gay marriage was morally wrong.

Chapter 17: Project MKUltra

January 28, 2020

In 2018 I completed my video work and I have not returned to video since. This does not mean that I will not create video projects for myself in the future, but what it does mean is that the mission for my video project was completed. With ""This Book Is a Game"" now complete, my writing work is coming to its finalisation. This does not mean that after this book that I will not write in my future. But what it does mean is that my mission for my writing project is coming to its completion. From 2018 to 2019 I finalised everything that I needed to say in video. And now I am finalising everything that I need to say in writing. I likely will do video and writing in my future. But it will serve a different purpose. Like stated in the last chapter, I am not required to perform the same monotonous task again and again like the brainwashed populace of our world. Once I have completed the work, it is done and I never have to do it again. I have so much work available that people can spend years watching and reading it and likely still have more of it to experience. It would take a really hardcore fan to complete my work. So what is the point of making more of it, especially when I have stated all of the fundamentals of what I am presenting? There is no point. The point is that my work is coming to its completion. And it will work for me for the rest of my life with little to no effort. I was smart. Actually, God was smart.

After my ex-wife left me, I was extremely depressed. I almost killed myself but right before the action, I literally passed out on the floor. This is when God literally revealed Himself to me. I spoke with God about my life and God revealed to me the next ten years of it. But what a task God assigned me! How was I, as one person, to accomplish all that God had set out for me? I asked God if I had a choice. God told me that I could end my life at this moment, for my choice was to follow the vision God had given me or commit suicide. I asked if those were my only options. They were. So I was to choose ten years of hardship or suicide. I chose the ten years of hardship not because that was what I wanted but because as a child I gave my life to God. Since it is God's life and not mine, I chose to endure the next ten years. For if I murdered myself, I would be destroying God's property. I could not bring myself to destroy God's property. So I lived to see another day and recommitted my life to God. However, I was not happy about this arrangement because I knew what was to come.

And now, ten years later, I am free. I am an independent game developer and I am not required to obtain and maintain a typical job. I spend a lot of my time playing digital games and this is now considered my work because the more games I play, the more ideas I can integrate into my own game. I am not speaking of ripping other games off, as you will see in my game Ivory Heart. This game is incredibly unique. However, other games do assist in the creation of my own game. I can utilise techniques from other games to integrate into my game.

I have a method for recording one's thoughts that was passed on to me from a high. Just start writing your heart out about all the things you care about in life. You can write with a phone or a camera. Both are effective mediums to collect and convey information. Mix it up and use writing to assist your video work. You are not locked in a box.

And what are you to record? The answer is your heart. Imprint something on to this world in which you will be proud of. Use the educational ladder to convey your messages. But a heart is extremely complex and there are many sides to it. Yes, this is true which is why it is extremely important that you document it. Because you are extremely unique and you and your achievements deserve to be documented and showcased.

The development of Ivory Heart the video game is going very well. I can envision the game in my head. In addition, I have already created beautiful 3D environments to explore. Soon I will be working on quests. But this type of video game is not at all easy to create because it will have no violence in it. A game like this has never before been created. That is the advantage of being a philosopher. What you produce is incredibly unique and you will have no competitors. For this is not just a game to collect book chapters. The chapters are complimentary materials for the quests in the game. The quests are not linked to the information in the books. The chapters are the rewards for successfully completing quests. The chapters will in no way hold the game hostage. Because the learning will occur when interacting with the characters and performing their assigned duties.

Ivory Heart is a game created to inspire young girls to live a life of virtue quite literally saving the world. The heroine is the saviour of the game world. But her quests do not end in-game. The quests will be designed to teach the player what actions they need to make in real life in order to make a difference in this world. Ivory Heart is a finishing school for young girls. It teaches the ways of wisdom through an electronic classroom environment. It provides the player with a great deal of study materials that they can bring with them wherever they go. That is why it is important that I release my game on the Nintendo Switch. My game is being created with portability in mind. My game will provide all of the study materials required to successfully complete all its courses. My game is the future of the classroom. Physical buildings where school shooters love to play are so old school. I am literally converting the physical buildings into a digital atmosphere. My game will stand as a solid attempt to reinvent the ways in which we educate our young.

What teachers do you want to teach your children? Children deserve the best teachers possible but unfortunately our world is filled with terrible teachers. The best teachers will create new and innovative methods to teach their content. Eventually, this will put most teachers out of a job. This is a good thing and not a bad thing as we remove all the terrible teachers from the world and replace them with innovative creators. The world of our future education implementation is digital and it is now time to purge all who are analogue. The teachers of face to face are now obsolete. For we now have digital warriors who educate much more efficiently and effectively than the physical classroom environment. Who will you choose to educate your child? A gunman? A teacher that is so bad at their job that they couldn't even escape the nine to five? The teachers of the future are those who educate worldwide and not those who focus on their physical environment. How effective is a teacher that can only reach twenty kids? My reach is infinite and repeatable. For I live in the clouds. I only have to teach a lesson once and it is publicly available for all who are interested to learn from. 

The truth is that the education system is exploiting your kids. Yes, they babysit for you, but that is about how far their helpfulness goes. They know about online education and they know that they could reach the entire world if they wanted to. But they want your money and a scope like that is not profitable. That means that they value money above the well-being of your children. I truly care about your children and I could care less about your money. Who is the better teacher? Why would you allow this to go on? The answers are right in front of you. Our modern day education system is a mechanic in society utilised to brainwash the population. The point of school is to get your child into a nine to five. Does damning your child to the nine to five life sound like a loving thing to do? Of course it isn't. But here is the truth: most parents do not truly love their children. Just as the school exploits children, so do their parents. As children grow, parents begin to wonder what they can get out of their children. Most children of this world are slaves to their parents. And it is even common ""wisdom"" that parents should not be friends with their children. How ridiculous is that? If a parent of mine doesn't want to be my friend then I don't want to be their child.

We live in an age where that is very possible. If you have terrible parents, renounce them. If they do not have your best interest in mind, then flee from them. I was emancipated from my parents at the age of fifteen. They were taking actions against me that hurt me on a regular basis. Do not put up with that regardless if they are your parents or not. You deserve respect and if your parents are not going to give it to you, then don't give it to them. Just because they are your parents doesn't mean that they are family. In this day and age we choose our family. Who is my family? Those who do the works of God are my family. Does my family do the works of God? No, they do their own works. It is easy to see who does the works of God by analysing their works and its attachment to God. If their works are not associated with God, then they are not doing the works of God. See in what name they proclaim their works. For it is that name that is written to their hearts. And that name is usually money.

CIA-controlled responses show desperate efforts to control the fall so that they can control the damage and starting positions of players after »reboot«.

BTW, YT channels like ADVChina etc are talking about  Xi’s talk about the market reboot and new beginning that is coming. But they fail to interpret that in the global scope – Xi/CCP seems to be saying that »reboot« is coming globally.  

It looks like »Mountain of Mordor/Germany« UfD is waiting for CDE to go down with inept Frau Merkel after the crash, when things are about to get extreme. This point will be used for the rise of new, »Fourth Reich«, this time with most of the »bugs« and snags of the previous versions avoided, removed or worked around.

It’s not clear if that is original intent of GWO or just compromise that they are expected to accept along the way. Formally, this is to be known as new EU with its armed forces, space program (WeltraumWaffe?) etc. Or perhaps they count on this new EU only as a temporary step ( just so it isn’t too obvious) after which FR,IT, etc are expected to leave and leave Germany with (national) socialism of some sort, bunch of vasal states on the south and east of the Europe up to Bulgaria etc.

856,Throwaway03220,ev408i,"Is it just me or is news about the US Air Force Air Combat Command plane crashing / possibly being shot down by members of the Taliban in Afghanistan's [eastern Ghazni province](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPSH8KqX4AEUXoL?format=jpg&amp;name=small) being suppressed by most major US news media outlets?

From what I've been able to find via Twitter searches on the topic it was initially reported by media yesterday that the plane was not one of ours, but instead was a passenger jet belonging to Iranian Ariana Airlines. The airline quickly denied this claim stating all their flights were safe and accounted for.

Shortly thereafter a spokesman for the Taliban, a man by the name of Zabihullah Mujahid, posted on his Twitter *(honestly didn’t know terrorists used Twitter spokespersons until today)* that insurgents with the group had shot down the plane and that it had confirmed deceased CIA officials on board. 

Following Mujahid's announcement, U.S. officials reported to [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/27/799967351/u-s-plane-goes-down-in-afghanistan-prompting-wave-of-questions-contradictions) that the plane was a U.S. Bombardier E-11A, and that it had “two people on board, both of whom died in the crash” after the plane went down due to what they’re calling “mechanical problems.”

In culmination of all of this, Russian media, citing Russian intel, [is now saying](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/top-cia-chief-behind-soleimani-21375358) that the plane shot down yesterday was carrying CIA Chief Michael D’Andrea, the head of CIA operations against Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq, who is said to have helped plan America's drone strike on Iranian General Qassem Soleimani earlier this month. This revelation is allegedly being reported on Iranian state TV.

You can verify for yourself via the photos I’ve linked below that the USAF plane seen in the videos of the wreckage is more than likely the same plane in the pictures.

**Photographs of the plane and wreckage:**

- [Twitter Video 2 at USAF Plane Wreckage Site](https://mobile.twitter.com/usmilitaryupd8/status/1221789729861009414)

To my untrained eyes, the fuselage of the plane appears to have suffered more than just “mechanical problems,” although that term itself is rather vague and nondescript. That being said, all pilots are trained to land planes even when there are mechanical issues with their aircraft.

**These pertinent questions remain to be answered:**

1. Why wasn’t there breaking news about this on the major news networks yesterday?

2. Why would you fly that large of an aircraft over Taliban controlled area, especially with only two people on board?

3. Is Michael D’Andrea confirmed deceased?",conspiracy,Major US News Media organizations not reporting on the USAF Air Combat Command plane that crashed in Afghanistan yesterday

So in 2nd Enoch's book from old testamet you can read that ""God""(God could mean more advanced civilisation looking like us IMO) shown him Sun cycles,Moon cycles,Sun and Moon names and what is very curious is 364 days year cycle in Chapter 1 Verse 16.

We calculated that year is \~ 365.242189 days long.

Maya civilisation for example were able to calculate it being 365 days too.

Was ""God"" not right and teached Enoch wrong?

What do you think about possibility of every next year cycle being longer than previous one?Maybe Vatican and THEY made us believe year is 365,24 days long and we don't even question it anymore because we are ""sure"" year is 365 days long so whou would waste time and do research to find out year is truly 365 days long?

I think there is also a posibility of every Earth cycle being slightly longer than previous one.I'm no astronomist or ""scientist"" but this is how I would see it.

Enoch was 7th generation after Adam.We don't know exactly when Adam was created,5000 years ago,10 000,20 000,50 000?We don't know it.

[Maya civilization existed](https://www.ancient.eu/Maya_Civilization/) \~7000-2000 BC only God knows when they were able to calculate 365 days cycle.They could be able to do it 5000BC or 3000BC,we don't know it for sure.

If we assume Enoch lived before Maya civilization and at his time year was 364 days long then Maya civilization was created few thousand years after him and for them year now has 365 days.Few thousand years pass and now we calculate year is 365,24 days long.How do we explain it then?It looks like every next earth cycle becomes longer,is Earth moving slightly further away from sun every year?

Often the discussion on this forum revolves around the elite class, and how they differ from the masses.  

There is only one difference.  The elites on this planet have been privy to the true nature of consciousness, and human existence.  The true human history.  They wield this knowledge as a weapon against the ""unwashed masses"".

How does it make you feel to know that privileged humans on this planet have access to universal truths that govern our existence, but refuse to share that knowledge with all humanity?  Truths which could set you free from your own existential crises, and allow you to live a life free from the burdens of oppression and slavery.  Technologies which could heal your illnesses, and rekindle your spirit, imagination, and drive to find purpose in you're own life.  

They think you aren't smart enough, important enough, or powerful enough to know the true meaning of existence.  They think they are acting in you're best interest.  They think you need to be herded, coerced, and lied to in order to create ""a system which works for everyone"" all while hiding the true nature of human life from those who need to understand it the most.  They honestly believe that it is necessary for you to be repressed and lied to, for you're own well being.       

They allow suffering on a global scale, just to keep the status quo, and keep things controllable.  They don't think you are capable of self determination.  They think you need to be managed as if you are livestock.  They think you will not be able to fully comprehend the nature of our existence, even though our creator embedded in each and every one of us, the desire to know the truth, and understand the significance of the smallest action and feelings.  They have convinced themselves, that there needs to be an elite class of humans ruling all others.  They will lie, murder, and erase history to keep this status quo.

Consequently, China might become the leader in a new kind of technology, that every nation will face in the future, and have an undeniable excuse for customers to buy their 5G and robotics technology.

This is worse than you think! 



The governments and tv reports are hiding the truth about the virus and how fast it spreads and how strong it is.

We all see in the Televisions, articles and in websites about the latest happenings in China. But that is not exactly true. 


People inside Wuhan and other provinces are suffering from the effects of the virus. 

People from Wuhan tells their experience in the social media, some of the videos are shutdown by the authority, and posts are being tracked by them.

A busy road with so much people becomes ghost town in just days.

Hospitals and doctors are also suffering from the effects of the virus.

They lack power and equipments to function well and their strengths are also deteriorating.

In fact doctors are also dying because of the virus, they sacrificed themselves for the people, to cure them. 

They work endlessly to prevent the virus and the spreading of this. 

Some of them are treated poorly by patients and other doctors and nurses are being spit by other patients, wanting to them die also.

Patients were suffering due to the lack of doctors and nurses and also spaces in the Hospitals.

These situations are not being announced and declared by the government though they reported that they will build 10 Hospitals in 10 days for the Victims of the Virus.

It's a good news for the people.

Other nurses and doctors reported that they were also lacking of disposable suits and masks.


If the reports of these people are true then this Country will die because of their Pride.

I believed that other countries are willing to help them if they will allow them


So far there are some reports that some people recovered completely from the virus, but we dont know how true is it.

They dont want to cause widespread panic across the world, so Chinese government and Western governments are keeping information regarding the virus and potential pandemic very quiet. This is worrying seeing as the infection rate is rapidly increasing, started in the highest populated country in the world, the strict quarantine and hazmat suits/ check points should be a very big scary awakening. Parts of China are very much looking apocalyptic, very similar to something you would seen in a zombie Hollywood film.

Wuhan is a very large city with a population over 11 million, the entire city is under quarantine lockdown. Very serious action to take for a virus the media is saying not to worry about. With a population of 11 million and a virus symptom free period is a deadly combination. How many people have the virus without realising, and can also still spread the virus without knowing.

Wuhan is also home to a biological studying facility, recently testing Flu virus. Very interesting how this has emerged 2miles down the road to 'bio-weapon factory'

At this point of this post, 106 people dead. This statistic is MUCH higher, most likely in the thousands, loads of video footage leaked online from Chinese citizens displaying overcrowded hospitals, dead people in the street, families screaming and torn apart due to infected being taken and quarantined and instant cremation. 

The global elite (SATANIC CABAAL) have been planning a mass de-population static for many years. The rise of AI is in perfect timing for the replacement of mankind as we no longer are of use to the elite in power. A virus they have manufactured which only the rich and powerful/chosen are given the antidote/vaccine.

The virus has began from some sort of animal, evidence is pointing towards a snake. Virus that start from animals are incredibility difficult to battle, due to the body having no natural defence and can very easily and quickly become deadly. 

A very well timed Netflix series regarding global flu pandemic which realised bang on time with the spread of the infection. Perfect example of predictive programming.

I recommend to just be precautions to stock up on food/tinned goods, medication and water(atleast a 2 week supply). If this was to become a pandemic, medical supplies and produce will become very limited especially to smaller towns/cities. Bigger cities with higher population will recieve the priority of goods and medicine. Hospitals will be overwhelmed with medical admissions. Buy a battery powered radio system, to keep in the loop if all media has a black out.  Also keep a small amount of cash as back up, as if S\*\*\* hits the fan, banks, ATMs and pretty much anything will be closed.

889,Jam102,ev2o5p,"Just a thought that occurred to me.

There's lots of information and theories about why we have so many systems in place along with many theories; population control, mind alteration, dominance etc etc.

However, what if all these theories are inherently wrong, and we've been looking at it the wrong way altogether.

Instead of a secret kabal of shadowy figures, systematically controlling everything like a chess game - what if we have innately created a system of control over the period of human nature, that allows us to control and limit our natural predatory and animalistic nature.

The thought first occurred to me when I watched a film based off a real social experiment. Most of you probably know about it:

Around 25 people were taken to a prison like building. Half became guards, half prisoners. With no interference from a controlling body, the guards quite quickly devolved into tormenting, abusing, dehumanising and eventually killing one of the prisoners. (really good film, Adrian Brody, Forrest Whittaker, check it out).

It led me to question how inherently good we actually are. You see the ""systems"" we have in place are constantly reminding us of moral goodness. The act of charity, of kindness. Would we need to be reminded so much so, if we were already inherently good.

OR

Are the systems we so often deride as controlling and oppressive, the very reason we're able to live in a functioning society, albeit with many problems, but still functioning.

It's quite sad but it seems like something horrible about a patient being mistreated and dying because of this is in the news frequently. I myself have spent lots of times in hospitals this last year and let me tell you first hand, it does not matter if you are old or young these hospitals and their workers will let you die before they give a shit about treating you.

Go in with a life-threatening emergency and literally have to wait 24 hours to get a proper hospital room (IF YOU'RE LUCKY) most times they will just turn you away. Being paraded with questions from dozens of different personnel, do these co-workers not communicate with one another, do they lack elementary communication skills?

Hard to believe right? Well there's a lot of ""who cares, not my problem"" attitude from A LOT of the personnel working at hospitals, it's fucking pathetic. Most treat it like any other job just trying to get a paycheck, and most young doctors are completely incompetent and seem to lack an ounce of common sense or education.

What kind of education are these new hires receiving before being thrown into the workplace literally not knowing anything. Is this more of an education problem, money allocation problem, or just how the healthcare system has seemed to shape up?

In all those months spent around hospitals.. out of the approximately 50 employees I had personally come in contact with I can safely say that about 3 of them seemed to know what they were doing, competent, caring, compassionate, and trying to make a difference (all older with what seemed like a lot of knowledge and experience in the profession). Every single young employee or employee with under lets say 20 years experience was a complete moron and didn't seem to give a flying fuck about the well being of anybody but themselves.

This is a bit of a word dump, and I'm on mobile so excuse my shit formatting, I just want to touch base with this community on this one.

I'm going to preface this by stating that I assume everyone reading this knows the current situation with the Hong Kong, and *many* other countries around the planets protests, Epstein ""dying"", and the state of unrest involving society these days.

Also, on a personal note. I have an 8 year old child that just came back from Vietnam two and a half weeks ago. And she has a virus that started kicking in about half a week ago. The docs are saying it's just a normal respiratory infection. 

Anyway. To the meat of this. 

I'm throwing around the idea that this pandemic is a diversion, but possibly a culling tactic as well. 

If people start catching this en masse? That is a huge red flag, and I'm getting the feeling that we are being predisposed to be okay with it.

Cities being quarantined is fucking insane in the first place, but if we start seeing it outside of China.. I'm pretty sure you all know what that is the prefix to.

On top of this, I'm thinking about the mass protests around the world regarding civil rights. 

We were (in my opinion) getting pretty close to the whole unified ""eat the rich"" moment that everyone that is paying attention has been waiting for. 

Now everyone who is following this (possibly man made pandemic) is looking out for themselves and their borders. 

In my opinion, this is classic divisiveness, on a global scale.

 I'm not sure if what I'm trying to articulate is what's going on, but I'd like to hear anyone's thoughts about this idea who has read this far. 

Also! If anyone reading this is in a country that is currently having any kind of protests, I would love to hear anything from the ground.

*L.A Reid, he worked with Justin Bieber when he was a kid and he said that Justin was ""as beautiful as a woman could be"", while this could be just pure coincidence and nothing do with this and just a weird creepy comment, it doesn't help that he was accused of sexual harrasment.

I still frequent mainstream media outlets like the [New York Times ](https://www.nytimes.com/) and [Reuters](https://mobile.reuters.com/) but I take everything that I read there with a grain of salt. News headlines and articles are often *framed* in a way by mainstream media in order to influence more than to inform and headlines  often tend toward biases and often the meat of the articles under biased headlines don’t correlate with what the headlines state or infer. 

An often used trick is to align pictures alongside headlines and articles which are meant to portray through pictures the bias or intent the outlet wants to infer—you’ll see a headline or article about *Y candidate* which may be unfavorable to said candidate and alongside will be a picture of *Y candidate* looking down sadly or with a frown or fraught look on their face. “The Walls Are Closing In On Trump” with a picture of Trump—one of hundreds snapped by paparazzi and media photographers within mere seconds—seemingly looking fraught or scared.

981,BWet00,euzxft,"I have spent far too much time researching Kobe's death. Held off on theorizing until now and am going to keep it short - as there are a lot of other details I found surrounding his death that are ominous and suggest foul play (Island Express in particular). I am convinced Kobe Bryant was a blood sacrifice. The parallels between his death and Whitney Houston was the capper for me. 

Timing of Kobe's death:

* Less than 24h after LeBron passes him on all-time scoring
* Right before the Grammys - oddly enough held at Staples Center
* Grammys were a public mega-ritual hidden in plain sight. A bunch of Satanists and Luciferianists performing with hellfire in the background while holding his jersey.
* ""Passing of the torch"" to LeBron

Whitney Houston:

* A major icon in music industry. Found dead at Beverly Hills in LA.  
* At exact same location, few floors below, a pre-Grammy award party was taking place w 800+ guests. 
* The following day, the 2012 Grammys took place and was tainted with her death. 
* It was nothing short of another public mega ritual. 
* Creepy, satanic, symbolism galore with Whitney's ""replacement"", Jennifer Hudson, \*literally\* placed in the spotlight.   Passing of the torch. 

Mega, multicultural icons ""passing the torch"", whose deaths cause shockwaves around the world. MKUltra and Spirit Cooking freaks in the cesspool that is Hollywood/entertainment feasting on the powerful energy, performing mega-rituals with literal hellfire in the background.

 Firstly the virus ""escaped"" a level 4 containment facility. I find that the most suspect. A level 4 facility is engineered to have several redundancy systems in place. The people working there are not stupid they are not going to accidently release something like this and the systems in place would have stopped it somewhere.

Secondly the timing is suspect, the virus starts spreading right before the largest annual mass migration of people. And the quarantine didn't take effect untill after everyone already left for their new years 


This is probably an engineered virus, probably not a leaked ""weapon"" otherwise the boarders would have been closed a long time ago and flights would have been restricted. The reason I suspect this I because the USA said they have something but they won't be deploying it yet. Why would they say this I think it's they have tools to deal with this engineered strain but they don't want to show their hand because it will diminish their effectiveness against a weaponized strain if one was to show up.

I'm not here to get into why she did what she did. Technically speaking, as far as her guilt is concerned, it doesn't matter. This post is to point out that the media was used to sell a false narrative to the public that none of these standards exist to protect such data and that she was not personally subject to them despite being the acting secretary of state.  
example:  [https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-told-fbi-she-thought-classified-markings-were-alphabetical-paragraphs](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-told-fbi-she-thought-classified-markings-were-alphabetical-paragraphs) 

After Clinton's crimes were made public, the subsequent cover up and trial-by-media had to be orchestrated from the top down to thwart the legal process already in place on both civilian and military fronts. Doing so undermined the integrity of the entire classified information program to anyone who uses it. Or perhaps it exposed how truly precarious a system is that blindly punishes or absolves defendants based on secret merit and by secret officiators? Regardless, Clinton's espionage was reduced to a partisan issue in order to baffle the public. It was never a partisan issue.",conspiracy,Hillary Clintons guilt demystified

9,5nordehacedod,ew6zs7,"This was posted over at r/China_Flu.  I am only pushing this information for you to see this.  This is not mine.

 This  video is shot be Chen Qiushi. He is a famous ""citizen journalist"". He  went to Wuhan before the city was locked down. He uploaded lots of  videos to report first hand what is happening in Wuhan. This is his  latest video and he is scared!!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXozpbomAns&amp;t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXozpbomAns&amp;t=2s)

The video is in Chinese, does anyone know how to add English cc?

 

This  video is reporting on what he saw on 29th January, it's long and less  constructive than his usual videos, and is more of a rant, I broke it  down into several points below:

1. Censorship

He  acknowledge that he's now being censored on weibo. Apparently just  saying the initials of his names or a picture of him is enough to get  you banned. He said that his new weibo account got banned again. He also  said this video is longer than his usual 5 mins video because those are  intented to be shared on wechat, but now its pointless because wechat  censored him.

2) Medical supplies

The  medical supplies situation is horrible, the hospitals received packages  of all sizes from all over the country. He mentioned that small  packages is probably more a bothersome than help because all the  hospitals need to assign people to unpack them, then organise the  supplies into different categories.

3) Hospitals

The  hospitals have less people compared to the days before. He said this is  more likely to be caused by the lack of transport in the city and that  most people are being self-quarantine at home. He followed someone who's  suspected to caught the virus for a day, they went to 5 to 6 hospitals,  and the situations is too chaos, and the queue to getting tests is  still very long. The person he follows talked to a doctor, who had an  argument with them that they need to show proper reports to get  diagnosed because of the lack of test kits. Despite that, the hospitals  are still mostly in order, and the doctors, nurses, security guards are  being as polite as they can. One of the hospital he went to have beds on  the hallways, in front of the toilet, everywhere. And 70% of the people  there are on oxygen supplementation. There's also someone he talked to  that said the people in the hospitals are being dispensed because the  premier of China, Li Keqiang is coming to visit them. **In  the hospital, he saw a woman holding up someone who's siting on a  wheelchair, and the person on wheelchair has no mask on, the woman said  he's already dead and they are waiting for the transport to come get  him. (He showed the footage for this)**

4) The constructions of the field hospitals

The  construction workers are pushing themselves to the extreme to build the  hospitals. A guy he interviewed said he only slept 2-3 hours everyday  in the past 3 days. There's multiple construction firms working on it at  the same time, and he thinks that might be a problem because of the  high quality requirement for the hospitals. He also answered the  question of some people had about why not just turn existing  hotels/apartments into hospitals: A proper quarantine hospitals are  divided into three areas: green/yellow/red. With the reds being  diagnosed and severe, and green being suspected cases. The red area  requires air tight rooms to prevent air with virus from going outside,  and proper water treatment equipment for the same reason. Which isn't  possible in normal hotels.

5) The news

He  said that the Chinese media does reports the situation, however, all of  the reporters are in full isolation gowns, and they are doing  interviews through phones, and they also only does interviews in the  green area (see the previous paragraph). Because he had no proper  training, he had to try and find some investigate journalist on twitter  to get some tips on how to do proper reporting, and he touch on how rare  it is to find those in China. He also said that he saw on the news that  a reporter from a Hong Kong media is in the city too, so he did all he  could to find that person's wechat, but the HK reporter said that he  didn't left his hotel in the past few days, because the company he works  for don't want their employees to take that risk. That's when he  realise he's truly alone in this.

6) Japanese people in Wuhan

He  briefly touched on that he knows a couple people from the Japanese  embassy, they helped him get to Japan in the past. He called them and  wanted to ask about the people who are going back to Japan, but the  embassy said they couldn't help him. He said he haven't read the news  yet, but it's very important to know that how many people among these  200 are infected.

7) On himself

He  said he's starting to freak out, because the situation does seems  pretty dire. He repeats several times in the video that he only reports  on either what he see directly, or from direct sources like the families  of the infected. And he said while the situation has put a lot of  pressure on him, especially since he has been reporting in hospitals for  the past few days with just goggles, face masks and his coat that he  disinfect regularly, he will try his back get back on his feet. And as  long as he's alive, he will keep reporting the truth. He said both the  Justice Bureau and the police called him to look for him. They also  contacted his parents. He admits that while he's afraid, as he's stuck  between the virus and the criminal justice system of China, he'll say  this: ""FUCK YOU! I'm not even afraid of death! Why do you think I'm  afraid of the Communist Party?!""

 

One point I forgot: the transport

He  mentioned that since all private transportation are stopped, taxis  became the main transportation in the city. Each streets in Wuhan has 4  taxis assigned to it, however he says that that number is not even close  to being enough because of the amount of people living on one street is  like tens of thousands. He also said that he was added into a taxi  driver chat group, and the taxi drivers know about the virus since mid  to late December, some of them stopped shopping at that wet market  completely because of this. And he also said that lack of transport  might be one of the reason that less people are going to the hospital",conspiracy,Firsthand video from Wuhan from Chinese Journlaist  China Coverup Coronavirus

We’ve all seen it. Be it YouTube, Facebook, even here on reddit.  

It seems more than ever all the low tier preroll adds you see are vastly adds for mobile games that look like utter trash.

They all advertise through one of a few themes. It’s either poor acting of people playing the game,  the “how to loot” puzzle game add, or just blatant false advertising of gameplay.

I understand that the AppStore and mobile games are pretty much solely supported by whales, or just a general small section of the user base that buys into MTXs.

But some of these games are just straight up dog doo, and are so obviously  riddled with pay to win/advance/speed up tactic that there’s no reason to play the game without spending money.  And while I do believe that there are valid players using these games and potentially buying into MTXs. To support all the add space these apps occupy has to cost a good amount of money. 

** So here’s the take.**

These games, at least a few of them, must be used as some form of digital money laundering.  There’s just no want they have the popularity to support all these adds and take up so much of my timeline. 

To me it makes sense, there are so many ways that money is stolen digitally, taking that money and validating it has to be filtered in some way to get it clean and what better way that payrolling some shitty app developer to generate a stolen asset AppStore game. Then you just spoof user data set up boys and start buying into the game.

Africa, however, did not care well. By 2022, over a million people across 48 African countries died after being infected with the Wuhan Virus, with more than 3 million being infected in total. The rapid spread of the virus and high mortality rate in Africa was purely down to poverty, lack of healthcare and poor containment.

Either things can happen or multiple things at different stages and levels in their career. If you try to leave, they usually destroy you or kill you. Look at DMX, Micheal Jackson, 2pac  etc

- China decided to quarantine Wuhan when there were “only” around 500 infected and 17 deaths.
From [this](https://www.google.fr/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/01/26/health/quarantine-china-coronavirus/index.html) CNN article:
The shutdown of Wuhan is ""utterly incredible,"" Howard Markel, professor and director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan, told CNN. “I've never seen an entire city 11.4 million people cordoned off like that,"" Markel said. ""I thought I'd seen everything.""
Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization's Center on Global Health Law, said the move was ""unprecedented,"" and, he thought, ""very unwise"". ""Nothing on this scale has ever been tried,"" he told CNN. 

- So in a country where 24000 people die every day, 4400 only from pollution, they quarantine 60 million people for just a flu with 17 deaths?

What reason could they have?
- (The only) One possible explanation is that they knew something else.
- And the (only) most plausible reason for them to know the seriousness of it is that the virus “escaped” from the lab (maybe an infected worker or animal?) and the lab informed the government about the seriousness of the virus  and the need for quarantine.

Chapter 19: The Light

January 30, 2020

My writing adventures are almost over! I can't wait until I finish because most of the feedback that I receive is abuse. After I finish a chapter, I advertise it publicly. And this always results in receiving a great deal of abuse from idiots who don't even read the entire chapter. The majority of the time they respond exactly how I say that they are going to respond in the chapter. People's evil actions against me always verifies my findings. But I am not for them. I am for the few. I don't care if 99% of what I receive is abuse. Because I am only for the 1%. But it takes great character to not take their insults to heart. In fact, if people respond in a hurtful way towards me, then they are immediately reaped and blocked.

But the scope of reaping souls extends far beyond that. To begin with, I do not need to tell the individuals that I reaped their souls. I just do that for show. It happens automatically. But the reaps don't only occur when people are rude to me. I have successfully reaped a soul when they read or watch my content and don't take its information to heart. All they have to do is read a few sentences and if they could care less about the vital information it carries, that is a successful reap. I intentionally put my material out there to reap the souls of those who possess no heart. For heart is the only thing that can save this planet. And we need to remove the souls from this world that have no heart. Reaping souls is a very real thing. For God sees all and God sees my reaps and the reasoning behind those reaps. People are stupid for not putting one and one together. It is their own damn fault and will result in their eternal damnation.

I am tired of constantly getting banned from places. My content is not welcome anywhere I go. Most communities will remove me from theirs. This is so annoying. I can't get my work out there because this world will not let me. After posting my final chapter I will be so relieved! It will mean the end of the constant abuse that I receive from the public because I will no longer be promoting my work. In the future, they will come to me and not I them. Posting my chapters on a public forum opens me up to abuse. The end is nigh! I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. One day I will be respected as an individual and not treated like trash on a regular basis. I look forward to that day where I no longer have to put up with the constant abuse. I have been receiving it since 2012. That will end in 2020.

The general public refuses to acknowledge me as a philosopher despite that being my major at university. The general public refuses to acknowledge me as a filmmaker, yet I have released countless films. The general public refuses to acknowledge me as an author even though I have written five books. How intelligent is the general public? How much sense does the general public make? Do not trust the collective for they execute prophets. There is no godliness in the opinions of the many. Question all social axioms as they are usually propoganda tools and are usually highly inaccurate. Do not allow the collective to take over your mind. Reject all mainstream celebrities. Stop watching their television. Avoid their employment system if you can. Don't get caught up in feeding the capitalistic system: live as a minimalist and don't focus your life around money. Do not immerse yourself in watching sports, for that practice encourages idolatry, gambling, unhealthy competition, and monotony. Try your best to avoid advertisements when you can, for they work on your subconscious. Avoid friendships that do not share your enthusiasm for virtue. It is better to be alone like I am than to have friends who bring you down as a result of their character. Those we spend most of our time around we become like. If you want to be a unique individual, spend a lot of time alone. Time alone is also excellent for inspiration. Spending a lot of time alone will shape you into your true self. Spending time with the wicked will rub wickedness off onto you. Be very careful about the experiences in which you choose in life. For they will shape your character.

Do not be afraid of death. Stand up to all forms of oppression. Put your life on the line without question when combatting those who are sinful.   Living in fear will turn you away from God. I am not scared of anyone or anything. I have faced all of my fears and now I have none. I am never frightened of standing up for what is right even when this lands me in prison. I am not afraid of the police who spend their days harrassing the virtuous. I don't care if someone has a gun, even when it is pointed at me. Go ahead and kill me. Let's see those results. I am not afraid of being robbed on the street. I would tell them to fuck off or kill me. They are getting my possessions over my dead body. This mentality is liberating. You will die whenever it is your time. This does not mean that you should provoke death. Allow what happens to happen and refuse to take any abuse despite who they are or what they want from you. Treat everyone impartially. Listen to what they want and if it invades your autonomy then stand up for yourself. I am not condoning violence. But I am advising you to not let others push you around.

In my childhood I learned a very important lesson that I will never forget. We always choose where we are. If you become uncomfortable somewhere, leave. It matters not if you get stuck somewhere or miss a ride home. What matters is that you are safe from the people that are hurting you. You can always walk away from any situation. It matters not what situation you are in or where you are. You can always find your way back home. Or you can always leave home. We always have choices and oftentimes just walking away from the situation is the best option. Do not allow others to make you feel like you are trapped. You never have to do anything that you don't want to. You never have to be somewhere that you don't want to be. Liberate your mind by liberating yourself from the enslavement of others. Do not endure hardship just to please another who is treating you poorly. Remember that you always choose where you are and this will avoid you much pain. I have gotten out of the car on a busy highway very far from my house before and then I spent the entire day walking home. I have walked away from fake friends who tried to force me to sin. Blackmail does not work on people like us. Neither does bribery. There is nothing another can do to corrupt me. Protect your heart with your life, for it is more valuable than your life. Don't let others blacken your heart, for that will have eternal consequences. Become like the wind and wend. Do not value the material but instead the spiritual.

I have spent my entire life outside of society looking down upon it and analysing it for clues as to why things are so bad. Something I have noticed is that society drives people away from one another. It is really difficult now days to find a friend who you trust. Divorce rates are half and most couples I see are unhappy with each other and their lives. People are unhappy everywhere I go. I am always happy and I want to share my happiness with others. I found the key to happiness in life and I made enough copies for everyone. I am disappointed by how miserable people are in this world and this causes me to work very hard to help others see the light. I know that I am controversial but I can't wake you up until I slap you out of your slumber. Despite what I have said throughout my work, I deeply care for people and want to see the best for them in life. Why else would I expend so much effort to bring this material to you, especially when I am constantly abused for it? I am trying my best to save the world and as a result the individuals within the world. But I can't do it without you. Please help me save the world.

And that is exactly what my work is: a solid attempt to save the world. Imagine if a lot of people spent their lives trying to save the world. Suddenly, delusions of grandeur become a reality. What I am unable to do alone we can do together. But our objective must be clear and not watered down. The objective is to save the world. We must not let this objective go despite what labels the doctors place upon us. The doctors are the ones who are insane by incarcerating and torturing those who spend their lives trying to save the world. Why would anyone try to save the world when fake doctors are punishing them for doing so? This practice discourages people from attempting to save the world because apparently that is a mental illness. Be very sceptical of everything mainstream society tells you. For most of it was created with a devious agenda behind it. The social elite are trying to send everybody to Hell by encouraging wicked practices within society and discouraging acts of virtue. Those on the top doing this to you are spiritual people. They are not atheists or agnostics. In fact, they are Satan worshippers. I have studied a great deal into the occult. They are controlling and directing this world. And their greatest weapon is sexual immorality.

Sexual immorality directly results in wicked people and the occult know this. So they structure their media to encourage this behaviour, normalising it to such an extent that now days it is unheard of to be a virgin until your marriage. They might not yet openly encourage polygamy but they do openly encourage promiscuous behaviour, moving from partner to partner, trying out their sexual organs like they were on display at a store. I have had two sexual partners in my life and I regret both of them. One was my ex-wife who left me. The other was my ex-fiance who also left me. I only ever wanted one sexual partner in my life but I failed at that because these women did not appreciate how obsessed I was with virtue. I failed and this was my fault. I should have waited for the perfect match. Instead, I worked with what was available. I did not see the perfect match anywhere so I settled. Do not settle in a relationship. Find your soul mate or be alone. Jumping from sexual partner to sexual partner will corrupt your soul. For when love is reduced to mere infatuation and sexual satisfaction, the meaning of love is lost. Those who have had many sexual partners have no ability to love. They are merely saying words that they understand nothing of. To truly love another one must love their soul. If one does not believe in souls then love is not a possibility for that person. If one does not love themselves then they can never love another.

Most people in this world hate themselves. This is because they live selfish lives and it is not possible to be happy when invested in this type of lifestyle. The only way to obtain true happiness in life is to give your life over to the public. A life wasted is a life entirely invested in themselves and no one else. Do not fool yourself into thinking that selfish desires like having a family or working in an employment system is a compassionate cause. Helping your friends when they are in need is also not a compassionate cause. Most activities in life in which we collectively consider compassionate causes are not. Even most charities are operated by the rich and as a result are structured to get the rich richer and the poor poorer. There are so many activities in this world that are disguised to appear as if they are a compassionate cause when in fact they are hurting our society. This is why you must be careful of who you donate to. For you will be held responsible for your actions if you make the world a worse place by investing in a ""compassionate"" cause. In order to truly love yourself you need to have a clear conscience. You need to know that the actions you take in life are truly a good cause. I recommend not donating to typical charities. Instead, create your own charitable investments and watch them come to fruition. Only invest in a charity external of you when you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that what they are doing is in fact good and not evil. Do not be tricked for there will be consequences.

I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. A life free from constant abuse is so near! Sure, that means that I will no longer be advertising my work which means that many will miss out. But I have spent ten years trying to reach everybody I could. Ten years of constant abuse is enough for me. All those in my future can find me or miss out. The work is all publicly available. It just means that people will have to come to me instead of I them. I apologise to those who will miss out because of this development but there is only so much abuse one can take before they have to flee from the people inflicting the abuse. And I did not stop in the middle of something. My work came to its natural conclusion. It is like a television show finale that also came to its natural conclusion. The shows are always there publicly available to anyone who wishes to experience them, however, they will no longer be promoted. I pray for search results to one day lift their shadow ban on me. But this likely will not happen because my content is so controversial. As a result, I must rely on word of mouth from the individuals in which I did manage to reach over the last ten years. There is a point where we are required to give the rest to God and allow things to be as they will be. One person can only move the world so much. It takes an army to change it.

I am creating an army to combat the end times. If you are interested in joining me, please invest yourself into my work and follow its directions. I give very clear instructions albeit spread throughout my work. But it is created like this in order to train you to become a mighty warrior. One who is weak cannot help in this war. My work was created to make you strong. Use my work to become strong. Open your mind and allow it to brainwash you. For there is no better way of thinking. My work was created to brainwash not only myself but also others who are interested in flipping their lives around. In truth, the work is designed to reverse the brainwashing that society has already inflicted upon you. How much do you value your soul? You will not regret investment into it. For its rewards are infinite. Do not work for the material but instead the spiritual. What you cannot see bears much greater significance on your life than what you can see. Most are just blind to this truth. Why do you think this world is so miserable? Because the material is unable to fill the void in your soul.

We live in a simulated world. Everything here has been designed to test your spirit. For God will only allow those who are worthy to live in His presence. God had to find a way to separate His whites from His blacks. Heaven could not be possible if everyone was allowed in. Heaven had to be created from the righteous souls because evil ones would corrupt it. In order to safeguard this haven, only the best of the best were allowed in. Do not feel sorry for those who have damned their own souls. If God allowed those who are unworthy to enter into His Kingdom then it would not be heaven. People oftentimes remark how a good God would allow everyone into heaven. But such a place would be called Hell. It is not possible to create a righteous environment from those who are wicked. Our souls will return where they belong. If you want to live in a paradise after your death then you have to obtain the qualities of said paradise. It is not like we will die and then change who we are. Our souls will act how they were trained to and if they were trained to be evil then the soul will be released to others trained in the same manner. Evil souls will torture each other after their death. And good souls will live harmoniously together under the rule of God. It is not possible for an evil soul to become good after its death. As a result it ends up where it belongs. The statement that a good God wouldn't damn anyone is cryptically true. Because the souls damn themselves through the actions in which they take in life. There is no paradise in the afterlife for those who refused to implement paradise here on Earth. Such a notion of saving those who spent their lives committing sin is nonsensical. They would ruin our heaven if they were to be allowed in. As a result, there souls will end up in the blackness in which they cast in life.

But I see such great potential in you! You can live eternity in paradise with me! We can spend forever getting to know each other and working together to create the best heaven possible. There is no sleep in heaven and as a result we must occupy our time with projects that are meaningful. God has promised me my own world in which I can form and shape in heaven. Maybe we could build it together? Or maybe you would like your own world to craft? The heavens are the limits. You need only become worthy of the task you wish to perform in heaven. Build your life here on Earth to prepare for your life in heaven. An eternity is a long time to prepare for. Those who spend their lives in boredom cannot enter the kingdom of heaven. Because how could you be happy for eternity if you are unable to find meaningful things to do with your time? Seize the day! Carpe diem! You only have one life to prove that you are worthy of heaven. Do not waste it.

99,Better_Understanding,ew12ar,"The output of sense organs is first received by the thalamus. Part of the thalamus' stimuli goes directly to the amygdala or ""emotional/irrational brain"", while other parts are sent to the neocortex or ""thinking/rational brain"". If the amygdala perceives a match to the stimulus, i.e., if the record of experiences in the hippocampus tells the amygdala that it is a fight, flight or freeze situation, then the amygdala triggers the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis and hijacks the rational brain. This emotional brain activity processes information milliseconds earlier than the rational brain, so in case of a match, the amygdala acts before any possible direction from the neocortex can be received. If, however, the amygdala does not find any match to the stimulus received with its recorded threatening situations, then it acts according to the directions received from the neocortex. When the amygdala perceives a threat, it can lead that person to react irrationally and destructively.

Goleman states that emotions ""make us pay attention right now—this is urgent—and gives us an immediate action plan without having to think twice. The emotional component evolved very early: Do I eat it, or does it eat me?"" The emotional response ""can take over the rest of the brain in a millisecond if threatened.""An amygdala hijack exhibits three signs: strong emotional reaction, sudden onset, and post-episode realization if the reaction was inappropriate.

Goleman later emphasized that ""self-control is crucial...when facing someone who is in the throes of an amygdala hijack"" so as to avoid a complementary hijacking—whether in work situations or in private life. Thus for example 'one key marital competence is for partners to learn to soothe their own distressed feelings...nothing gets resolved positively when husband or wife is in the midst of an emotional hijacking.'  The danger is that ""when our partner becomes, in effect, our enemy, we are in the grip of an 'amygdala hijack' in which our emotional memory, lodged in the limbic center of our brain, rules our reactions without the benefit of logic or reason...which causes our bodies to go into a 'fight or flight' response.""

t.
the roman optimum: stability from c. 100 b.c. to 200 a.d. Exceptional climate stability characterizes the centuries of the Ro- man Empire’s rise; certain regions enjoyed unusually favorable conditions. In the western Roman Empire, the arst century b.c. through the arst and possibly second century a.d. were warmer than later centuries. Archaeological evidence from Britain, ice- core data from Greenland, and dendrodata about summer temperatures 


from Austria all agree on this score, as does the fact that the Alpine glaciers were retreating and, in the arst and second cen- tury a.d., relatively small, comparable probably to their extent c. 2000 a.d. Two potential climate-forcing factors both show un- usual stability. Within the generally even level of solar activity be- tween c. 200 b.c. and 600 a.d., the centuries from 200 b.c. to 100 a.d. stand out as particularly stable (Figure 1a). An exception- ally low level of volcanic activity also prevailed from c. 40 b.c. to 150 a.d. (Figure 2b). In central Greenland, temperatures became warm from c. 20 b.c. to c. 75 a.d. A stable, relatively cool period followed from c. 100 to c. 270 a.d. (Figure 2c). The speleothem in Austria’s Spannagel Cave indicates stable conditions until about 250 a.d. (Figure 1b). Written sources from about 75 b.c. to c. 175 a.d. emphasize moisture (Figure 6a), predominantly in the form of the oooding of the Tiber River recorded at Rome. Pre- cipitation in northeastern France was stable and largely balanced, ouctuating within narrow margins, also until about 250 a.d. (Fig- ure 5b). Quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions deduced from pollen deposits in the Eifel maars (lakes formed from extinct vol- canoes) also point to a stable climate pattern overall (Figures 3 and 4).6
In detail, the chloride (Cl-) levels from Greenland indicate that sea ice retreated, implying that warming occurred between about 15 b.c. and 40 a.d. Cooling resumed with sea-ice expan- sion, peaking c. 70 a.d. before renewed warming in the last years of the arst century (Figure 2a). The Greenland ice cores signal slow, slight cooling starting in the second century a.d. and contin- uing to about 270, implying longer winters in the North Atlantic (Figure 2c; cf. Figure 11). The Austrian alpine dendrodata indi- cate that the warm summer temperatures c. 85 b.c. cooled until c. 35 b.c., followed by general warming interrupted by some cool years c. 20 a.d. and again between about 75 and 93, perhaps re- lated to the Vesuvian eruption that destroyed Pompeii in 79 a.d. (Figure 5a). Nevertheless, the Alpine glaciers experienced a long retreat, and warm temperatures dominated in the Austrian Alps through the second century, punctuated by further cool spells

135,Rhodies_never_die_,evzbs7,"I keep seeing this point pushed, but it is entirely false.

This entire situation stems back to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in WW1. T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) was sent to the Hijaz to rally the Arab tribes against their Ottoman overlords. In exchange for opening up another front against the Ottomans, the Arabs were promised Palestine. The Arabs were actually remarkably successful, but that's a story for another time. 
However, the English had other plans, much to Colonel Lawrence's chagrin, if the sources are to be believed. Arthur Balfour, the British foreign secretary, negotiated with Lord Rothschild, who stood as a representative of the international bankers, to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. This led to the issuance of the Balfour Declaration.
His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. 2 November 1917
This was effectively the birth of Israel, notice the date, still in the middle of WW1, but everybody knew that Palestine would be under British mandate because the Sykes-Picot agreement was signed the year prior. Obviously you can see why this greatly angered the Arabs in the region, they had effectively paid for that land in blood. I also believe that they had a hand in the Sykes-Picot agreement, it effectively neutered Muslim power in the region. I think they purposely split the Middle East into divided, weak countries to better set the stage for the coming of Israel.
Now this is where it gets interesting. What did Lord Rothschild offer Arthur Balfour in exchange for a Jewish state in Palestine? What could be so valuable to drive the British foreign secretary to establish a new state, effectively out of thin air? This is the theory I support, presented to me by my Middle Eastern history instructor at USMA. The bankers used their influence to drag the isolationist US into WW1, in exchange for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. Remember that Germany wanted peace talks in late 1916, and the British refused, despite being beaten badly on all fronts. We entered the war 6 months later. I think that the establishment of Israel was payment for this, it seems that they paid for Israel with OUR blood. This is the only connection the US has with the establishment of Israel.",conspiracy,America was not responsible for the creation of Israel

Kinda weird, then I thought about it, the Antichrist is said to be born near the Middle East area.  You may or may not know but Obama and his parents always say that he was born in Hawaii because you have to be born in the US to be president.  And the whole argument is he wasn’t born there because all his relatives and rest of his family say he was born in Africa, more specifically Kenya.  And I mean, Kenya is pretty damn close to the Middle East.  And for Meghan, the whore of Babylon is said to come from the west.  And Meghan was an American actress before marrying prince Harry.  America=West.  Also, the whore of Babylon is supposed to be publicly nice and kind but actually evil.  And you can look up the fact that her family on her side talks about how nasty and mean she can be to people in private.  There are also some other little similarities you can find between these two people of power and the two powerful evil figures from the Bible and other holy text.

As someone with a little bit of medical and forensic expertise, here are a few reasons I believe why, feel free to CMV.

1. Bioweapons are never intended to be released at epicenter locations. Assailants rely on convenience, ease of infection, and incubation periods to spark the fire and do most of the damage. Everything that follows is a step-ladder of consequences. But why Wuhan? Is it their virology lab? Probably not. Not all weapons need to be manufactured and incubated in a lab, in this case it was 'simply' cross-infection with an animal-linked pathogen. Again, the incubation period is what matters. The fact that a virology lab was next door and this non-human virus was incubating publicly for this long is what the concern should be, not whether or not the laboratory deliberately constructed it. In other countries, this would be seen as criminal negligence since it's impossible for an institute of that caliber to exist and not notice something afoot within the local populace, experts HAD to know. Either they were powerless to say anything, or were forced not to. 

2. To obfuscate the nature of the weapon and avoid public backlash. Covert infiltration relies on back channels in order to remain effective through secrecy. This is why bioweapons have remained effective for decades, because nobody ever gets the time to raise suspicion into if an outbreak was a targeted attack. The only people left to deal with reality are future historians.

Deflation, on the other hand, is good for the exact inverse: it increases your currency's value and allows you to buy more with the dollars you already have, the increased savings promote investment, and it rewards people like lenders and savers who aren't idiots with money.  Gold is naturally deflationary, so a gold currency is best.

It stands to reason that the American people have ceased to have a truly free market backed by sound economics since 1913 with the dual strangulation of the federal income tax and the Federal Reserve.  All of the inflation since then has rewarded useless public sector workers and welfare sponges who don't work, while squeezing the producer class into virtual nonexistence.

The interesting information was what it was doing in the region. You've undoubtedly heard that the US was conducting intelligence on Iranian General Qasem Soleimani before his assassination. The information they gathered beforehand, came from intelligence assets involved with Soleimani and involved with Taliban.

Those assets were located in Taliban territory in Afghanistan. 

The helicopter that crashed in Afghanistan, was conducting an Intelligence operation when it was shot down. They were using listening devices to receive ground information from the assets in the Taliban encampment.

6 people died in the incident. Including 4 operatives and 2 pilots. 2 were CIA and the others were Marines.

If you ever need proof of human gullibility, cast your mind back to the attack of the flesh-eating bananas. In January 2000, a series of chain emails began reporting that imported bananas were infecting people with “necrotizing fasciitis” – a rare disease in which the skin erupts into livid purple boils before disintegrating and peeling away from muscle and bone.

According to the email chain, the FDA was trying to cover up the epidemic to avoid panic. Faced with the threat, readers were encouraged to spread the word to their friends and family.

The threat was pure nonsense, of course. But by 28 January, the concern was great enough for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a statement decrying the rumour.

Did it help? Did it heck. Rather than quelling the rumour, they had only poured fuel on its flames. Within weeks, the CDC was hearing from so many distressed callers it had to set up a banana hotline. The facts became so distorted that people eventually started to quote the CDC as the source of the rumour. Even today, new variants of the myth have occasionally reignited those old fears.


After all, humans are naturally drawn to the titillating and sensational. Think car wrecks, plane crashes, people being scammed out of their life savings. Women’s Health writer Zahra Barnes attributes this allure to the human instinct. For one, seeing other people’s pain helps reassure us of our own safety. And it also allows us to experience a form of emotional escapism. She compares the exhilaration of hearing about other people’s tragedies to the that of riding a roller coaster:

     “When you're on an amusement park ride and plummeting toward what feels like certain death, you're in it for the thrill of being terrified—without putting yourself in the face of any real danger.”

Just like the movies, we come to view other people’s pain as entertainment. 

While science may have an easy explanation for why people can’t turn away from tragedy, the real question for me is, why are some people so gullible in the first place?

This fresh Chinese Coronavirus outbreak strikes me as a false story or even maybe a falseflag op. It was conveniently timed for maximal impact ( Chinese new year, HK, Taiwan tensions etc), on best area ( Wuhan - frequent human traffic and bio-tech companies etc).Media response carries characteristic ""attack"" signature fake solidarity and care.

Moreover:

* Wherever one looks, USA and Israel etc are never far away. For example:  
[Biotech Chinese and Israeli Strategic Collaboration: Pontifax and WuXi PharmaTech (Cayman) Inc. (NYSE: WX)](https://pharmaceuticalintelligence.com/2014/11/03/biotech-chinese-and-israeli-strategic-collaboration-pontifax-and-wuxi-pharmatech-cayman-inc-nyse-wx/)
* This is not the first time China is exposed to this. During WWII, Japan has held many Chinese in their concentratioin camp, formed with bioweapon development as a sole purpose. They were used people as a simple biomass for whatever they needed ( [UNIT-731](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731) ). Compared to Unit-731, Aushwitz looked like a bootcamp. After the war, USA snatched the results of their work, giving leading researchers an asylum. 
* Chinese primary strength is copy-cat art, not original development.
* There were some news not that long ago about US military (Navy?) looking around for specific Russian genotypes
* Even \_if\_ original leakage is from Chinese biotech farm, the company itself was formed after importing key people, technologies and data abroad.
* EU is being aggressively cleansed during last few years. Basic tool for this is surveillance network and tech for area protection. People are constantly evaluated and those that fall below certain level are silently removed. It is not uncommon sight to see whole groups of ""civilians"", poisoning unsuspecting target's food while shopping, trying to infect it with mist and saliva etc.  
Good point of dotting the i was, if initial attack is succesful and target needs medical attention, to repeat the attack in waiting room etc.  

* The used to use common pathogens and simple bio-tools (contaminating food with feces, using simple poisons, or prevalent virii of the opportunity). This meant substantial protection, they had to be immune or disinfected, frequently they had to use eye antiseptic ( characteristic ""red eyes"" etc). Nowadays they use less and less protectionn, which means that bio agents are more and more targeted.
* It looks like surveillance network is used for this. Once target is marked as ""terrorist"" and put under constant surveillance, it is not difficult to plan point of attack and choose particular  compound. After the attack, they monitor targets response in real-time. Data goes through the network up to developers, which use the data for next batch.
* They seem to abuse DNA evidence materials for this purpose. It used to be that they collected is just for identification of suspicious individuals. Then came IA and started to massively use it for evidence planting ( drug traffic, pedophilia etc). And now they seem to be using it for biowarfare.

Questions:

* If this is a part of bio-weapon development, how likely is it that Chinese are simply trying to catch with the west ?
* What is the current state of the art on the west ? How targeted and predictable can these weapons be ?
* What would be the primary purpose of using such weapons ?  
\- intimidation of key individuals in government and industry  
\- additional weapon for WW-III (killing the survivors or cleaning the areas of initial attacks)  
\- population control

Julian Assange's famous [interview on Nieuwsuur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=23), where it's thought he alluded to Seth being the leaker.

A few days ago, while I was browsing through conspiracy videos on YouTube, it recommended to me a video on a board game.
At first, I just wanted to get back to the videos about WW1.
However, maybe it was fate, or just a glitch, the recommended video was about a board game called Ultimate Werewolf.
Unfortunately, I will not post links here.
Moreover, the original version of werewolf had another name: Mafia.
The very essence of game play is on information asymmetry.
Unfortunately, I will admit that the real world is not played by only two teams.
Although, i wish it was that simple (us vs TPTB).
We at r Conspiracy is at a information disadvantage.
And if you disagree, then I wish to ask you to start naming names of the TPTB.
After all, we are not at a disadvantage, so we must be able to name them all, right?
Even worse, the moderators in the real world cannot prevent the werewolves from cheating, if the moderators even exist or not compromised.
We don't know who is TPTB and we need to worry about collateral damages, unless we are willing to sink to the ethics level of TPTB.
If that is the case, we will lose, since they are more experienced in such expressions of violence.
Oh, and the Nash equilibirum can be applied to Mafia game.
To paraphrase , 50 werewolves would have almost a 50% chance to win among ten thousand people.
If only we were so lucky.
By the way, in the game, the werewolves can only kill one person a night.
In the real world, the modern military enables the werewolves to kill more than one person.
Worse, there are assassins, propaganda, and false flags, so you cannot even tell who actually killed who.
So, that 50% chance of victory, TPTB just rigged the so-called coin toss to their favor. And that is assuming only 50 people are part of TPTB.
By the way, the Ultimate Werewolf variant also included vampires.
Chances are we, the villagers, are not just fighting TPTB, we need to fight their competitors as well.
Once again, the information asymmetry kicks in, since we don't even know who the vampires are in the real world. 
And that is assuming there are no variants such as: goblins, ogres, and dragons.
Honestly, our victory condition, if exist, look no where near achievable.
And even if we can properly investigate TPTB without harming innocents, how should TPTB be punished for their crimes?
Life in prison might as well be a slap on the wrist.
And if we bring back the death penalty, how can we make sure such punishment will not be abused in the future.
Humanity can't even properly police themselves now!

https://www.scribd.com/document/326057027/Amended-Complaint-Filed-9-30-2016#from_embed?platform=hootsuite

2) This lawsuit was dropped. Plaintiff’s lawyers say because of intimidation (which is documented behavior in other cases). Skeptics say because there was nothing there. Fair enough.

3) But then we learn that more than two dozen other women have accused President of sexual misconduct, that he describes “grabbing women by the pussy” whenever he wants (something Epstein also used to do BTW) and describing perving on beauty pageant contestants on Howard Stern.

4) Then allegations surface from several Miss **Teen** USA contestants describing exactly the perving the President himself described to Stern. https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2016/oct/18/allegations-about-donald-trump-and-miss-teen-usa-c/

5) It turns out the President is not the only one in the administration directly and closely connected to super-pedophile Epstein.

Also: Barr, Acosta, Ivanka, Mnuchin, Melania, Bannon, Trump Model Management, and Mar-A-Lago. All these “coincidental” connections are solid and verifiable with a quick search.

6) It comes out that Alan Dershowitz and super-pedophile Jeffrey Epstein were indeed close friends. The source?

Why it’s 2003 Alan Dershowitz:

“I’m on my 20th book. The only person outside of my immediate family that I send drafts to is Jeffrey [...] I would be as interested in him as a friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about his ideas.” https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey-epstein-200303

We are the fattest first world  nation in the world.  Hell, we are up there with EVERY nation in the world. I used to be fat, I mean, obese, so I can notice these things much more than the average person.

I truthfully believe we will not have socialized healthcare due to obesity. These people are making too much money on this issue. Heart disease is the #1 killer of Americans, next is cancer. The former being brought on by obesity (or at the very least, accelerated by) . This massive healthcare cost is around 5-10% of healthcare spending. This would be a massive cost for the taxpayer to burden, and that money could be spent on ""better "" things for the government to spend that money on without the taxpayer resisting higher tax burden (ie MIC spending) . 

Not to mention, all the profiteering going on and the incentives (and I am sure, lobbying) to keep people addicted to this crap food. The fact that sugar (HFCS) is in the white bread, says enough. 

Mickey D's, BK, Taco Hell, Coka C, PesiComp, and al th others, have MASSIVE incentives to keep people eating their food, and that added sugar, fat, and salt, keeps people coming back for more. All the damn extra calories are enough to equal an entire meal! Its basically capitalism out of control, knowing that these substances are addictive to the human body due to them being in such low amounts through out history (wild animals are lean and glucose can be rare). 

Nationalized healthcare would force society to take a look at the lack of chooses available and re evaluate them (ie, loss of profits) .

The different of responsibility alone FEELS like a conspiracy when individuals are blames for these lack of choices in a healthy diet (unless you want to cook everything for yourself, or know the calorie content of ALL your food, while fighting an uphill battle against this entire society) .  We all know that the school lunches wee not in the slightest healthy , despite them having plenty of fat and protein (yet little vitamins) . Walking tacos, pizza (the vegetable . HA!), candied apples, burgers, fries, etc...is very telling of our culture. 

Breaking free of this, as a formerly obese person, I realize my mating choices are SEVERELY limited due to being a fit person in an area (the Midwest) full of people who accept the standard and live like I used to (ie, how most of us are FORCED to live) . I know for a fact, It was not at all easy and I admit that during it, I could NOT have done it without HELP! I definitely have an incentive in lowering the obesity rate.

The 90s and 2000's  was focused on combating obesity in America, as schools began to remove soda machines and ice cream machines from their cafeterias, moving for more healthy options. By the tail end of the 2000s, America was no longer the most obese country in the world and heart disease rates were rapidly falling.

And then suddenly something changed. Celebrities and social media begin to push the ""woke"" idea of fat people as a race. Health at any size and body positivity begin trending everywhere almost overnight. Comedians like Bill Maher started to get shut down for their fat jokes, and celebrities losing weight quickly went from a PR Miracle to a scandal.

Most of the users on Reddit pushing this shit had zero Post history, and the change was so sudden it seems extremely unlikely that it was organic. Obese celebrities have begun rising to the top of the charts, many of whom had little to no Talent.

Cut to 2019 and every single Elementary School in the country has soda and snack machines back in their cafeterias. My University shut down its sushi/smoothie bar and reopened it as a McDonalds.

Taking a look back at our history, there are plenty of examples of large monolithic Industries trying to inject their product into pop culture for acceptance. Look at the cigarette companies! They spent billions funding social campaigns and phony health studies to make sure that their products were seeing as trendy healthy. They didn't give a shit that they were killing people, so long as they made a profit.

Snack companies certainly have a lot to gain by this. All through the 90s and 2000's they were spending billions into alternate more healthy organic recipes to their snacks so they wouldn't cause as much obesity. These same companies have pretty much abandoned these projects at this point.

By weaving fat acceptance into cancel culture, they have pretty much guaranteed that they will continue killing people for the foreseeable future as obese Americans gladly die on the altar of there now socially approved hedonism.",conspiracy,Snack companies used social media to push the fat acceptance movement in the exact same way the tobacco company is pushed cigarettes

365,ShellOilNigeria,evp97x,"THERE’S WIDESPREAD CONCERN that video cameras will use facial recognition software to track our every public move. Far less remarked upon — but every bit as alarming — is the exponential expansion of “smart” video surveillance networks.

Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance. In the not-so-distant future, police forces, stores, and city administrators hope to film your every move — and interpret it using video analytics.

The rise of all-seeing smart camera networks is an alarming development that threatens civil rights and liberties throughout the world. Law enforcement agencies have a long history of using surveillance against marginalized communities, and studies show surveillance chills freedom of expression — ill effects that could spread as camera networks grow larger and more sophisticated.

To understand the situation we’re facing, we have to understand the rise of the video surveillance industrial complex — its history, its power players, and its future trajectory. It begins with the proliferation of cameras for police and security, and ends with a powerful new industry imperative: complete visual surveillance of public space.

Video Management Systems and Plug-in Surveillance Networks
In their first decades of existence, CCTV cameras were low-resolution analog devices that recorded onto tapes. Businesses or city authorities deployed them to film a small area of interest. Few cameras were placed in public, and the power to track people was limited: If police wanted to pursue a person of interest, they had to spend hours collecting footage by foot from nearby locations.

In the late 1990s, video surveillance became more advanced. A company called Axis Communications invented the first internet-enabled surveillance camera, which converted moving images to digital data. New businesses like Milestone Systems built Video Management Systems, or VMS, to organize video information into databases. VMS providers created new features like motion sensor technology that alerted guards when a person was caught on camera in a restricted area.

As time marched on, video surveillance spread. On one account, about 50 years ago, the United Kingdom had somewhere north of 60 permanent CCTV cameras installed nationwide. Today, the U.K. has over 6 million such devices, while the U.S. has tens of millions. According to marketing firm IHS Markit, 1 billion cameras will be watching the world by the end of 2021, with the United States rivaling China’s per person camera penetration rate. Police can now track people across multiple cameras from a command-and-control center, desktop, or smartphone.

While it is possible to link thousands of cameras in a VMS, it is also expensive. To increase the amount of CCTVs available, cities recently came up with a clever hack: encouraging businesses and residents to place privately owned cameras on their police network — what I call “plug-in surveillance networks.”

By pooling city-owned cameras with privately owned cameras, policing experts say an agency in a typical large city may amass hundreds of thousands of video feeds in just a few years.
Detroit has popularized plug-in surveillance networks through its controversial Project Green Light program. With Project Green Light, businesses can purchase CCTV cameras and connect them to police headquarters. They can also place a bright green light next to the cameras to indicate they are part of the police network. The project claims to deter crime by signaling to residents: The police are watching you.

Detroit is not alone. Chicago, New Orleans, New York, and Atlanta have also deployed plug-in surveillance networks. In these cities, private businesses and/or homes provide feeds that are integrated into crime centers so that police can access live streams and recorded footage. The police department in New Haven, Connecticut, told me they are looking into plug-in surveillance, and others are likely considering it.

The number of cameras on police networks now range from tens of thousands (Chicago) to several hundred (New Orleans). With so many cameras in place, and only a small team of officers to watch them, law enforcement agencies face a new challenge: How do you make sense of all that footage?

The answer is video analytics.

Video Analytics Takes Off
Around 2006, a young Israeli woman was recording family videos every weekend, but as a student and parent, she didn’t have time to watch them. A computer scientist at her university, Professor Shmuel Peleg, told me he tried to create a solution for her: He would take a long video and condense the interesting activity into a short video clip.

His solution failed: It only worked on stationary cameras, and the student’s video camera was moving when she filmed her family.

Peleg soon found another use case in the surveillance industry, which relies on stationary cameras. His solution became BriefCam, a video analytics firm that can summarize video footage from a scene across time so that investigators can view all relevant footage in a short space of time.

Using a feature called Video Synopsis, BriefCam overlays footage of events happening at different times as if they are appearing simultaneously. For example, if several people walked past a camera at 12:30 p.m., 12:40 p.m., and 12:50 p.m., BriefCam will aggregate their images into a single scene. Investigators can view all footage of interest from a given day in minutes instead of hours.

Thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence, summarization is just one feature in BriefCam’s product line and the rapidly expanding video analytics industry.

Behavior recognition includes video analytics capabilities like fight detection, emotion recognition, fall detection, loitering, dog walking, jaywalking, toll fare evasion, and even lie detection.

Object recognition can recognize faces, animals, cars, weapons, fires, and other things, as well as human characteristics like gender, age, and hair color.

Anomalous or unusual behavior detection works by recording a fixed area for a period of time — say, 30 days — and determining “normal” behavior for that scene. If the camera sees something unusual — say, a person running down a street at 3:00 a.m. — it will flag the incident for attention.

Video analytics systems can analyze and search across real-time streams or recorded footage. They can also isolate individuals or objects as they traverse a smart camera network.

Chicago; New Orleans; Detroit; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Hartford, Connecticut, are some of the cities currently using BriefCam for policing.

To Search and Surveil
With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. This provides authorities the power to index and search a vast database of objects, behaviors, and anomalous activity.

In Connecticut, police have used video analytics to identify or monitor known or suspected drug dealers. Sergeant Johnmichael O’Hare, former Director of the Hartford Real-Time Crime Center, recently demonstrated how BriefCam helped Hartford police reveal “where people go the most” in the space of 24 hours by viewing footage condensed and summarized in just nine minutes. Using a feature called “pathways,” he discovered hundreds of people visiting just two houses on the street and secured a search warrant to verify that they were drug houses.

Video analytics startup Voxel51 is also adding more sophisticated searching to the mix. Co-founded by Jason Corso, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, the company offers a platform for video processing and understanding.

Corso told me his company hopes to offer the first system where people can “search based on semantic content about their data, such as, ‘I want to find all the video clips that have more than 3-way intersections … with at least 20 vehicles during daylight.’” Voxel51 “tries to make that possible” by taking video footage and “turning it into structured searchable data across different types of platforms.”

Unlike BriefCam, which analyzes video using nothing but its own software, Voxel51 offers an open platform which allows third parties to add their own analytics models. If the platform succeeds, it will supercharge the ability to search and surveil public spaces.

Corso told me his company is working on a pilot project with the Baltimore police for their CitiWatch surveillance program and plans to trial the software with the Houston Police Department.

As cities start deploying a wide range of monitoring devices from the so-called internet of things, researchers are also developing a technique known as video analytics and sensor fusion, or VA/SF, for police intelligence. With VA/SF, multiple streams from sensors are combined with video analytics to reduce uncertainties and make inferences about complex situations. As one example, Peleg told me BriefCam is developing in-camera audio analytics that uses microphones to discern actions that may confuse AI systems, such as whether people are fighting or dancing.

VMSs also offer smart integration across technologies. Former New Haven Chief of Police Anthony Campbell told me how ShotSpotters, controversial devices that listen for gunshots, integrate with specialized software so when a gun is fired, nearby swivel cameras instantly alter their direction to the location of the weapons discharge.

Officers can also use software to lock building doors from a control center, and companies are developing analytics to alert security if one car is being followed by another.

Toward a “Minority Report” World
Video analytics captures a wide variety of data about the areas covered by smart camera networks. Not surprisingly, the information captured is now being proposed for predictive policing: the use of data to predict and police crime before it happens.

In 2002, the dystopian film “Minority Report” depicted a society using “pre-crime” analytics for police to intervene in lawbreaking before it occurs. In the end, the officers in charge tried to manipulate the system for their own interests.

A real-world version of “Minority Report” is emerging through real-time crime centers used to analyze crime patterns for police. In these centers, law enforcement agencies ingest information from sources like social media networks, data brokers, public databases, criminal records, and ShotSpotters. Weather data is even included for its impact on crime (because “bad guys don’t like to get wet”).

In a 2018 document, the data storage firm Western Digital and the consultancy Accenture predicted mass smart camera networks would be deployed “across three tiers of maturity.” This multi-stage adoption, they contended, would “allow society” to gradually abandon “concerns about privacy” and instead “accept and advocate” for mass police and government surveillance in the interest of “public safety.”

Tier 1 encompasses the present where police use CCTV networks to investigate crimes after-the-fact.

By 2025, society will reach Tier 2 as municipalities transform into “smart” cities, the document said. Businesses and public institutions, like schools and hospitals, will plug camera feeds into government and law enforcement agencies to inform centralized, AI-enabled analytics systems.

Tier 3, the most predictive-oriented surveillance system, will arrive by 2035. Some residents will voluntarily donate their camera feeds, while others will be “encouraged to do so by tax-break incentives or nominal compensation.” A “public safety ecosystem” will centralize data “pulled from disparate databases such as social media, driver’s licenses, police databases, and dark data.” An AI-enabled analytics unit will let police assess “anomalies in real time and interrupt a crime before it is committed.”

That is to say, to catch pre-crime.

Rise of the Video Surveillance Industrial Complex
While CCTV surveillance began as a simple tool for criminal justice, it has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry that covers multiple industry verticals. From policing and smart cities to schools, health care facilities, and retail, society is moving toward near-complete visual surveillance of commercial and urban spaces.

Denmark-based Milestone Systems, a top VMS provider with half its revenues in the U.S., had less than 10 employees in 1999. Today they are a major corporation that claims offices in over 20 countries.

Axis Communications used to be a network printer outfit. They have since become a leading camera provider pushing over $1 billion in sales per year.

BriefCam began as a university project. Now it is among the world’s top video analytics providers, with clients, it says, spanning over 40 countries.

Over the past six years, Canon purchased all three, giving the imaging conglomerate ownership of industry giants in video management software, CCTV cameras, and video analytics. Motorola recently acquired a top VMS provider, Avigilon, for $1 billion. In turn, Avigilon and other large firms have purchased their own companies.

Using a feature called Video Synopsis, BriefCam overlays footage of events happening at different times as if they are appearing simultaneously. For example, if several people walked past a camera at 12:30 p.m., 12:40 p.m., and 12:50 p.m., BriefCam will aggregate their images into a single scene.

He withheld vital foreign assistance for personal political gain. That can’t be allowed to stand."" People don't change their viewpoints this drastically in 24 hours with no new details emerging.

Everyone knows that China recently abolished the one-child policy, but the policy's impact had massive repercussions. The policy led directly to the biggest issue facing China today and especially the future: the gigantic population of retirees that will soon become a reality. The large schism between the old and the young will be devastating to economic growth and create a huge social burden on the working class. So my main point is what if China engineered the Coronavirus to cull the old population in order to prevent future social unrest? We know that the epidemic so far has only killed people older than 55; the communist party has the means and the pragmatism to carry it out. The whole epidemic is just a utilitarian attempt at social engineering.

437,Yaakov117,evlufe,"Wealth is disproportionately concentrated in the hands of global Jewry. Depending on the year in question, the percentage of the Forbes 400 for the four hundred wealthiest Americans is usually around one-third or more despite comprising just 1.5% of the US’s population. In 1987, Nathaniel Weyl found [23%](https://racehist.blogspot.com/2009/10/changes-in-ethnicnational-origins-of.html) of American billionaires were Jewish, whereas for the last decade, the number has settled in at around 35%. In both 2009 and 2013, for example, Jews represented 35% of the list. 11.6% of the world’s billionaires are Jewish, despite Jews accounting for 0.2% of the world’s population. Jews are over 100 times more likely to be billionaires than everyone else on earth. Five of the top seven wealthiest Aussies are Jewish, despite accounting for less than 0.5% of the nation’s population. [20% of Britain’s “Super Rich” are Jewish—and most of them are immigrants](https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/wealthiest-jews-in-britain-were-born-abroad-super-rich-list-reveals-1.54747). All of Monaco’s billionaires are Jewish. Jews are 25% of Canada’s billionaires (at roughly 1% of the population), 13% of Brazil’s (at 0.5% of the population), and 43% of the Ukraine’s (at roughly 1% of the population). Jews are roughly 17 times more likely per capita to make the Forbes 400 than is the rest of the American population. 46% of Jews earn more than $100,000 a year, compared to 19% among all Americans. IQ differential alone is not enough to explain this disparity; the overrepresentation is too dramatic.

[Jews, by the way, are 26.4% of South Africa’s wealthiest individuals whilst representing an absurdly small .014% of the population](https://www.sajr.co.za/news-and-articles/2016/12/12/jews-make-up-26-4-of-sa's-wealthiest-citizens). They have profited enormously from [the diamond trade](https://medium.com/@AspieSavant/when-diamonds-were-a-jew-s-best-friend-bae3d1577ffc). Things are clearly going well for the Jews in South Africa, but for whites it is a different story. Per Henk van de Graaf: “The farmers live in fear, because being a farmer in South Africa is the most dangerous occupation in the world. The average murder ratio per 100,000 for the population in the world is nine, I believe. In South Africa, it is 54. But for the farming community it is 138, which is the highest for any occupation in the world” (Chicago is 28 per 100,000 and St. Louis is 35.3 per 100,000 residents as a point of reference). Whites are less than 9% of the South African population but are 40% of all murder victims. South Africa has a 95% black-on-white murder rate and the world’s highest rape rate. There are government-sanctioned policies to seize land from white farmers and re-distribute it to markedly less productive blacks. It should be noted here that the virulently anti-white Economic Freedom Fighters Party, helmed by Julius Malema, derives its funding from Jewish-Swazi billionaire Nathan Kirsh.

The music industry is, as with all forms of media, dominated by Jews, and its control has become increasingly centralized, another trend we’ve seen irrespective of the industry in question. In December 1998, with the PolyGram-Universal merger, the music industry’s Big Six became its Big Five, in control of 77.4% of a market estimated to be between $30 and $40 billion; 2004 saw another merger, this time of Sony and BMG, to create a Big Four. Coupled with the shrinking of independent labels, the Big Four were in control of a whopping 88% of the market by 2011. In December 2011, EMI was absorbed by the Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment, though in Europe regulators forced Universal Music to sell off its EMI assets which became the Parlophone Label Group, and was then promptly acquired by the third member of the Big Three, Warner Music Group. In 2012, the Big Three represented 88.6% of the market.

A snapshot of the leadership of the Big Three proves illustrative; this overview from December 2019 reveals an obscene overrepresentation of Jews including Michael Lynton, Chairman of the Board for the Warner Music Group and its Vice Chairman, Len Blavatnik; of the nine other members of the Board, Noreena Hertz, Ynon Kreiz, Thomas H. Lee, and Alex Blavatnik (Len’s brother) are Jewish. Mathias Dopfner is a Gentile, but is also a self-described “non-Jewish Zionist.” The rest, such as Stephen F. Cooper—also the CEO, replacing the Jewish Edgar Bronfman, Jr.—are either contested or I could not definitively find out. Co-Chair and CEO of Warner Records, Aaron Bay-Schuck, has Jewish ancestry, and other prominent Jews in management include the COO of subsidiary Atlantic Records Group Julie Greenwald and its CEO Craig Kallman. Universal Music Group Chairman and CEO Lucian Grainge is Jewish, as are: Chairman and CEO of the Universal Music Publishing Group’s global publishing division, Jody Gerson; Chairman and CEO of Universal Music UK and Ireland, David Joseph; and Executive Vice President of Marketing Andrew Kronfeld. Sony Music CEO Rob Stringer is Jewish, as is its COO Kevin Kelleher, Executive Vice President and General Counsel Julie Swidler, and President of Global Digital Business and US Sales Dennis Kooker. In other words, all three major record labels are headed by Jews and their corporate governance is dominated by Jews as well. The rest, like RCA Records CEO Peter Edge, are “well-liked Gentiles.”

Just four conglomerates control 90% of the entire US media market today, which includes television, films, telecommunications, and more: Comcast (including NBCUniversal), Disney, ViacomCBS (controlled by National Amusements), and AT&amp;T (including WarnerMedia). These conglomerates are, in fact, almost entirely Jewish-controlled. Jews are overrepresented at places like CNN (a WarnerMedia subsidiary) by a factor of twenty-five and are over-represented among senior executive positions at the major television broadcast networks, cable networks, and movie production companies by a factor of 44.5!

Chapter 18: How to Get Rich

January 29, 2020

What is the value of a human life? In order to answer this question we must first assess the life in question. What did they do with their life? The sad truth is that most people don't do anything of a positive nature to this world. So let us now rephrase the question. What is the value of a wasted human life? The majority of people in this world waste their lives away. So the question is then generalised and then brought back to its original premise, what is the value of a human life?

I used to highly value all forms of life. But the more I learned about humans and their ways, the more disgusted I became. Humans are not worthy of your time. The majority are evil and will hurt your God-given mission. These lives are a cancer on our species. The original question is nonsensical because they not only add no value to our collective evolution but actually subtract from it. They are not only worthless but end up costing us a great deal to the collective health of our human civilisation. These lives not only don't deserve what commodities they have been blessed with but also don't deserve the breath God has gifted them. They are useless eaters that keep our world in the past instead of looking towards the future. They destroy the works of God and they live lives of depression pulling everybody else in around them. A human life like the one I describe is a cancer to our society and we need to figure out ways to remove them from our presence. For having them as our neighbours not only hurts the collective evolution of our society but also the personal development of the individual.

Can people change? I am not saying that it is not possible for one who is evil to become good. But I have never seen it. We live by our nature and if our nature in which we built in childhood is evil, then we will stick to the ways of evil. How can someone become good when all they know is bad? Maybe there are few cases in this world where an evil person truly turned over a new leaf, but such occurrences are not at all common. This is why people should be judged based upon the actions in which they have already committed. Not actions that they may or may not commit. It is a fruitless endeavour to attempt to convert an evil person. I have tried this my entire life. Do not focus on those who are evil in this world. They had their chance and they failed. Instead, focus on those who are good. Avoid those who are mediocre, for they are just as harmful to your personal development as those who are evil. Those who enjoy making insulting comments on works of virtue in which they haven't read is an activity enjoyed by both those who are evil and those who are mediocre. Don't let them destroy your works through their unfounded insults. Don't work for God for fame. Instead work for God out of the conviction of your heart. It matters not if you make a video that still has no views after two years. God sees your toils. And it is your toils that will be judged, independent of whether or not humans accepted your information. If you tried your best in this life to save the world, then God will greatly reward you independent of whether or not your work made a significant impact on the world. For works of virtue are hidden in this world. God sees your heart. If your heart worked tirelessly in this life to bring about the kingdom of heaven, then God will reward your toils whether or not the world accepted your information into mainstream society.

Do not value human life that destroys human life. All human lives are not valuable. Most actually do damage to the cause of collective enlightenment. Collective mentality controls people. These individuals are not worth your time. They have already irreversibly destroyed any chance they have at obtaining heaven. For one must be fit for heaven to enter. How fit are you to enter heaven? Was your life spent helping other people or was it spent focused on yourself? After our deaths, our soul travels to the place it is most suitable for. If you live a wicked selfish life then your soul will join others who also lived a wicked and selfish life. If you were one of the few who lived a life of compassion, then your soul will return to others who have done the same. We create our heaven or hell through the actions in which we take in life. Where do you want to go? Do you want to spend out your eternity with other wicked people or do you want to spend it with those who are kind and compassionate? There is justice in our universe despite it not existing within our world. We will all be held responsible for the consequences of our actions. There is no escaping from the actions in which we took in this life.

Those who are most important in this world are not those who save lives. God will take people when it is their time and there is nothing that we can do about that. And the majority of people on this world are evil. How good would it look on Judgement Day for saving a lot of evil people? For the true liberators of the world are those who invest their entire lives in causes of compassion. Anyone can get a paid job as an ambulance driver. It takes real character to truly give your life over to the public. Value life insomuch as what is in your capabilities to save. But worry much more about saving the soul than saving the body. For a body will die in time whether or not it is saved. But a soul last forever and as a result it is a much more commendable life spent attempting to save others souls. Just because the worldly reward for saving a life is praise and the worldly reward for saving a soul is nothing does not mean that saving a soul is not important. Do not work for worldly rewards but instead heavenly ones. The true hero is not one who saves a life but instead one who saves a soul. For its consequences are infinitely more severe. Give your life over to the process of showing people the way to enlightenment. But before you can do that, you must first obtain enlightenment. You can't teach something in which you know not.

This world is structured so that only the social elite can succeed. Those who are not rich have no ability to truly progress in this world. Stars are created by the rich, not by the talents in which individuals hold. Investors invest in the rich and leave the poor without the ability to perform what tasks they were meant to in life. It is impossible to get on top without destroying all those who stand in your way. The system is structured to reward those who use unscrupulous methods to achieve their goals and punish those who live by a code. The social elite choose what is popular and what is not. However, obtaining such positions of power does not come without its consequences. For they have lost their soul. Their investors require certain behaviours from them and if they do not comply then they will lose their funding and as a result, their fame. I can say anything that I want because I have nobody over me telling me what I can and cannot do. As a result, I am free to be as controversial as I want. But such freedom results me in obtaining no investors which means that I cannot advertise effectively. This means that me and my work are hidden from the world. My website doesn't even show up in a search even if you type in the exact wording within it. My videos won't even show up even if you type the exact wording in it. Other results rank higher than mine that are completely irrelevant to the topic searched for for. The rich intentionally make it so the poor cannot succeed in life. The rich view the poor as their slaves. Because if they were able to succeed in life then that demeans their own life. So they literally place fail-safes in the technology to stop the poor from succeeding. For the rich need the poor working mundane jobs constantly in order to keep their position at the top. Currently, the richest 1% own more than twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people. In 2017, there were 7.53 billion people on this planet. Does this seem fair to you? Do the math. And they want to hire you to make them richer and keep you at the bottom.

Those who are spiritually dead are in truth not alive. And there is no caring about those who have already passed, for their home now is above or below depending on the actions in which they took in life. Those who have no ability to see spiritual value destroy the works of God. Do not sympathise with these people. However, my problem lies with the ""good"" person who watches evil unfold and does nothing to stop it. How can one call themselves ""good"" if they allow evil to prevail? They can't. Those who watch evil unfold without doing anything about it are just as bad as those who are committing the evil. This accounts for the majority of the population of our world. Hell will be chockablock full while heaven extremely spacious. It is like comparing a city to a rural town. It is only few who will enter the kingdom of heaven. And the only other option is Hell: for their is no middle. For those who were pure evil are just as evil as those who did nothing to prevent it. As a result, the mediocre will share the same residence as those who spent their lives immersed in devilish deeds.

""I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm - neither hot nor cold - I am about to spit you out of my mouth. You say, 'I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.' But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.""
Revelation 3:15-17

Those who love this world will also suffer the consequences of the actions that secular society has taken. Those who align themselves with the bad guys will suffer the same fate as the bad guys independent of whether or not they took those bad actions. For their bad actions was inaction in a time of need. For inaction is in itself an action. Do you want to know how to get rich? Redefine the term rich. For I am the richest person in the world. I possess enlightenment which is more valuable than all of the gold in the world. I am secure in where I am going after my death and as a result, I do not fear death. My riches are my works and my security in my afterlife. I have all that I need in this world because I have God and God gives me everything that I could ever desire. But God discourages greed and as a result, all of my extra income is spent on good causes instead of saving to obtain interest. I live a better life than any rich person lives and I live on a meager pension. What are riches to you? Rich people are not happy. Money cannot buy happiness. Financial freedom is entrusting all of your money to God even if this causes you to be homeless. True happiness comes from God and nothing on this world. Money can't make you happy. People can't make you happy. The only happiness a secular person can experience are fleeting pleasures that come and go like the wind. Because according to them nothing exists but what they can see. But nothing they can see will ever bring joy to their life. As a result, they live out terrible lives exploiting others because they truly think that there will be no consequences for their actions in the afterlife. The afterlife could care less whether or not you believe in it. After your death you will either awake to heaven or hell. While being tortured for eternity you are welcome to complain and say that you did not believe in the afterlife and as a result this shouldn't be happening to you. It matters not what you believe. The truth is the truth independent of whether or not you believe it. What you believe has absolutely no bearing on the truth.

Those who are rich are those who are rich in spirit. And for those who are rich in spirit it is also easy to identify others who are rich in spirit. God gives His warriors the powers of discernment and as a result they can easily see who is with them and who is against them. No one can ever trick me. I see through those who come to me with ulterior motives. To be rich is to be blessed with the vision from God. Those who truly dedicate their lives to God are given an alternative vision. God removes their nearsightedness and allows their vision to stretch not only all the way around the world but also into the heavens. To be rich is to have security in your afterlife. To be rich is to create a character in which it is impossible to sin with. I never do wrong. I always do right. I am constantly placed in situations that test my moral compass. And I always pass the test. I don't even have to worry about the tests. My actions always reflect my character. Those who commit bad actions have a weak character. Even if someone ""slips up"", this still reflects their character. If it is possible for you to sin then you are not saved. For salvation actually entails being saved from your sins. And being saved from your sins does not entail continuing to sin. If you want to stop sin once and for all, truly give your entire life to God. But listen to the words I am saying literally. Giving your life to God means that it is no longer yours and that will reflect in your actions. All these Christians getting ""saved"" is a big sham. They are merely going through a ritualistic process that attempts to redeem them from their sins. But it fails because they do not truly live their lives for God. Instead, they live their lives for themselves and try to go to church one day a week. Does a few hours a week sound like giving your life to God? Nay, they know not what they do. For there is no get out of jail free card in this game. We will all be held responsible for our actions.

To be rich is to give your life to God. To bask in that richness is to take actions on a daily basis that helps save our world. But in order to take those actions you need to know what and who you are saving the world from. The days of claiming you are something that you are not are over. For we can easily examine your works to assess your character. There are no Christians, no Jews, and no Muslims. For religions have been corrupted by identifying within them instead of learning their content. Religions are the ways of the old and spirituality the ways of the future. This mindset isolates me quite significantly because almost all who believe in God believe in a religion. This means that I am one man against the entire world. And here is the benefit of my riches: I win no matter what I do. Because I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am right. Because God has gifted me with spiritual powers that see everything clearly. In addition, I am possessed by Satan. The time for the Antichrist is coming. My time is coming. Now watch the world end. The time is nigh.

Tommy Wiseau was a man who seemingly came out of nowhere. He had a bunch of money, that noone still knows where he got it(selling fur coats according to Wiseau), and he made the 2003 best worst movie known as The Room. Not only was he the Director, the writer, and producer... but the lead actor. Sound familiar?

Comparing the two, they seem to be cut from the same cloth; low budget, bad writing, terrible acting, weird music(the main titles are eerily similar). I'm sure you could say the same with a lot of movies... but let's look closer; both films have a blonde love interest who is promiscuous. A leading man who shows off his bare ass. An overbearing mother says really awkward things. Again, you could see these character tropes in other films... but Wiseau has stated he had the idea/script for The Room in development for several years.

I propose that Tommy Wiseau was responsible for both projects. You don't just walk in off the street with millions of dollars and proceed to direct, write, produce, and star in your own film. No indie films prior? No filmmaker experience? No connections in Hollywood? Nothing. Wiseau is a very mysterious person... many aspects of who is and where he came from remain a mystery. 

I believe that Wiseau had SOME form of experience prior to The Room. Perhaps a terrible 3DO game? Perhaps he made him money from severance pay after being fired for making said game or selling his company? Plumbers came out in 94...

487,Ascetic_Ideal,evivyy,"In a way this post contains two distinct conspiracy theories, that I suspect may be linked together, hence my post.

A few years ago, I attended a private government research conference where Dr. George Church, Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and Professor of Health Sciences and Technology at Harvard and MIT, was describing how his lab systematically altered the genome of a bacterial cell using synthetic biology and genetic engineering to make cells resistant to viruses. There was some brief discussion of how these techniques could be used for the opposite purpose. Immediately following Dr. Church’s presentation, other researchers and myself had a discussion afterwards about how frightening these technological capabilities were. Over the years, this concern has always remained in the back of my mind and I’ve discussed it with others that didn’t attend the talk on various occasions. It is worth noting that a lot of George Church’s recent research also involves viruses, specifically adeno-associated viruses (AAV) (keep this in mind, it will be important later). Most recently in his career, Dr. Church has been funded by DARPA and IARPA, with the most recently funded grant titled, ‘Functional Genomic and Computational Assessment of Threats’ (by IARPA). 

The description of this grant solicitation, if you search for it, starts with:

“The biological sciences have experienced extraordinary growth over the past decade. Technological advances in DNA synthesis, sequencing, large gene construction, and data analysis are expanding biological research and the bioeconomy, and are likely to enable revolutionary advances in medicine, agriculture, and materials. At the same time, these advances have intensified security concerns around the accidental or deliberate misuse of biotechnologies. One special concern regards DNA synthesis technologies that can be used to create novel organisms.”

Hence, Dr. Church is obviously involved in the area of applying advanced techniques (lab based and computational) to engineer organisms to make them resistant to viruses (and potentially vice-versa, to engineer viruses), and is involved in the efforts to combat the risks involved.

Interestingly enough, Dr. Church was one of the scientists most involved with Jeffrey Epstein. He received funding from Epstein for the purposes of ‘cutting edge science &amp; education’ from 2005 to 2007 (the funding was apparently unrestricted). Epstein was convicted of soliciting an underage prostitute in 2008. Following his conviction, Dr. Church and Epstein continued to meet.  According to an NBC report, ""he had six phone calls and meetings with Epstein in 2014, as shown in Church’s online calendar (he has posted one every year since 1999). Sample entry: “Jun 21, 2014 Lunch w/ Jeffrey Epstein, 12-1:30, Martin Nowak’s Institute.” (Nowak, a Harvard biologist/mathematician, is also a Brockman client and Edge participant.) He also met with Epstein “several times” each year since, Church said.""

These meetings were often between Church, Epstein, and Church’s colleague Dr. Martin Nowak, Harvard Professor of Biology and Mathematics and Director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. At the get-togethers with Nowak, Church said, “Epstein seemed interested in the science of life’s origins and mathematically modeling the evolution of viruses” (among other things). Epstein had also previously given a whopping $6.5 million dollars in research money to Dr. Nowak’s lab at Harvard in 2003. Apparently, Epstein had actually pledged a total of $30 million dollars (which is an incredible amount of money for a university professor to receive for research; large government funded grants usually top out at $2-3 million over several years) to Dr. Nowak’s program (Harvard claims it never received the full $30 million however). I was not able to find additional information on what these talks in 2014 and beyond ultimately led to, or if more money was pledged to or received by these prominent scientific figures. Another thing to add is that Nowak also has a record of studying and writing about viruses, such as his first book publication in 2000 titled, Virus Dynamics: Mathematical Principles of Immunology and Virology.

Jumping to a slightly different topic of discussion. There are other two other posts that stood out to me in this sub. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ev7az3/wuhan_coronovirus_bioweapon_conspiracy_indepth/

This post describes a few things. First, Wuhan, China, the 7th most populated city in a country with 1.4 billion has a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory that was recently established in 2015. It is apparently one out of 70 or so in the entire world (number was given by OP of the post linked above; my own search only turned up 52), and it is the only BLS-4 lab in the ENTIRE country of China. For those unfamiliar with what BLS-4 refers to, they are labs involving the study of the greatest biological threats and have the highest level of biosafety precautions. It is the sort of lab where researchers would attempt to study and perhaps modify something like a coronavirus. As the other redditor pointed out (and is also outlined in other r/conspiracy posts), there are lead scientists, such as Xing-Ye Ge, that study coronaviruses based out of Wuhan. These studies are often carried out by a team of 5-20 researchers, usually across institutions.

https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Xing-Yi-Ge/5583604?sort=influence

If you look up the Wuhan scientists research profile, you’ll be able to find that this individual and his fellow researchers also publish studies on adenoviruses in bats (similar to Dr. Church’s own virus-focused work on adeno-associated viruses, which are similar to adenoviruses and have similar applications). Further searching indicates that adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses hold potential to serve as a vaccine for coronaviruses, and there are several studies on this. Dr. Church’s own work is tangentially related to this, as he studies adeno-associated viruses mostly in the context of delivering it as a sort of gene therapy. To be fair, however, these topics are outside my own area of expertise.

Now on to another recent reddit post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ev9adz/harvard_biologist_charles_lieber_taken_into/

In the last 24 hours, a colleague of Dr. Church and Dr. Nowak, Dr. Charles Lieber, Professor and Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University, was arrested and criminally charged over a contract he made with a foreign university. Where? In Wuhan, China. As a side note, it’s worth pointing out to those unaware that all three of these people are some of the highest-ranking academic officials at Harvard and are revolutionary scientists in their respective fields. They would not at all be considered minor or even moderately important figures at Harvard. 

According to the Justice Department: ""Lieber, 60, lied about his contact with the Chinese program known as the Thousand Talents Plan, which the U.S. has previously flagged as a serious intelligence concern. He also is accused of lying about about a lucrative contract he signed with China's Wuhan University of Technology.""

Apparently, amongst other things, Lieber established a secret research lab at the Wuhan university and was given $1.5 million dollars by the Chinese (in addition to salary and living expenses) to do so. Meanwhile “Lieber was also the principal investigator on at least six U.S. Defense Department research grants, with a cumulative value of more than $8 million, according to the affidavit. It also says he was the principal investigator on more than $10 million in grants funded by the National Institutes of Health.” So, Dept. of Defense… NIH…

For those that are unfamiliar with academia, you may be wondering “how often does a leading, well-funded academic scientist from the most prestigious university in the country set up a secret lab with a foreign government?” No, this doesn’t typically happen, and it is extraordinarily – and I mean extraordinarily – odd and suspicious. Researchers are sometimes solicited by foreign governments and will leaf or share info, but set up another lab somewhere else under the radar? Maybe a minor scientist would, but a major one? I’ve never heard of such a thing. Some other redditor mentioned that Lieber’s research seems to be mostly unrelated to bioweapons research, and this is true. Most oddly though, if you try to search Charles Lieber’s Google Scholar page (basically a page where you can find all scientific articles and books authored by a researcher), his page just went dark. It shows up in the Google search results, but says ‘No information available for this page’. I kid you not, his Google Scholar page went down as I was writing this post. When you try to click on it, it strangely links you to the Google Scholar page of some completely different person.

In my mind, these are a series of very strange coincidences that seem to be interconnected. As the redditor of the first link I posted put it, what are the odds that the new coronavirus that is now making world news just so happened to come out of the same place that the Chinese just set up their first BLS-4 lab a few years ago that also just so happens to be a place where researchers are studying coronaviruses? What are the odds that, again, just in the last several hours, one of the most prominent scientists at Harvard was arrested for setting up a secret lab at Harvard University? Also, why was Jeffrey Epstein giving heaps and heaps of money to researchers at Harvard studying synthetic biology and genetic engineering, who had the means to systematically alter cells or viruses – people receiving money from secret defense agencies such as DARPA and IARPA – and stated himself he was interested in modeling the evolution of viruses.

We need to look into these things further. Even if the Epstein-Church-Nowak part of the conspiracy doesn’t link to the Lieber-Wuhan Coronavirus portion, these two segments stand well on their own and I feel that despite having more of a background in nanotech instead of bioweapons, Liebers arrest for secret lab in Wuhan while the coronavirus problem continues to explode is just too much of a coincidence. Why would someone getting $10 million plus from U.S. funding agencies go through the hassle of setting up a secret lab in another country and risk his entire life’s work for less money. What was he doing there exactly? I eagerly wait for more details to come out.",conspiracy,Wuhan Coronavirus Jeffrey Epstein and Harvard University

It's not uncommon, especially during the winter months, to have an unpleasant encounter with a rodent who has made its way into a home uninvited. What many people do not realize, however, is that these pests can be much more than a nuisance. Rodents, such as rats, mice, prairie dogs and rabbits, are associated with a number of health risks. In fact, rats and mice are known to spread more than 35 diseases. These diseases can be spread to humans directly, through handling of live or dead rodents, through contact with rodent feces, urine, or saliva, and through rodent bites.

501,keptfloatin707,eviba3,"It's odd how the Gadsden flag has shifted once represented people who chanted "" No Taxation Without Representation ! "" now seems to represent people who don't care about paying more in taxes and receiving less.  


 In the late 1700's revolutionists fought against the British kingdom pretty much because they were taxing colonizers  and the colonizers realized they didn't really care for that. They were being taxed for everything and it was for no reason other than to fund the British Kingdom. They coined the phrase ""No Taxation without Representation!"" a saying synonymous with the Gadsden flag.   


Today, almost 300 years later, our country is being ran by a government that taxes its citizens but doesn't represent the citizens when it comes time to spend the money we generate. We bailed out banks that destroyed our economy in 2008, corporations that fed its workers starving wages with no benefits and we did nothing to help the common man survive through it. Millions of people lost their jobs their homes their livelihood. We didn't get bailed out, we didn't get huge tax breaks but we definitely picked up the check when the govt' handed out those trillions of dollars.   


Now today we see people who wave the Gadsden flag around but are against taxation with representation the very thing that flag came to represent. "" why should I pay for someone elses healthcare "" is a common talking point by this bunch. It's ironic really because that's infact what private health insurance is. You along with thousands of others pay premiums and copays so the next person on your insurance providers plan goes to the doctor they can make it more affordable.   


Why is it now the people who wave the flag or have it hung up in their home somewhere or post pictures of it online are the ones who don't support what it represents ?   


I personally, before doing research about my own bias, thought that flag had some racist background because well, I only see the flag at rallies where you see neo nazis and confederates hanging out.   


After doing my research I come to realize I am echoing the same sentiment that the first marines of our country were saying almost 300 years ago, despite being told by certain president supporters saying I hate my country.  


 I support the ideology of those who first fought to protect our country from tyranny. No longer would we be slaves to the machine that is our oppressor the British Kingdom and now our own government and politicians have become the current oppressors. They have convinced us that we are not entitled to be healthy, we are not entitled to get paid a LIVABLE wage - As FDR said a livable wage does not mean just barely getting by with a roof with holes in it over your head, no no no, a LIVABLE wage means we can get by comfortably. We hear the talking points all the time, ""why should I have to pay for this persons healthcare - they should get a job and get off drugs by them selves "" or ""People working at McDonalds don't deserve $15 an hour!"" the problem with that type of logic is it misplaces blame onto the individuals who are working for the machine that is our current oppressive government. What ever happened to "" don't tread on me!? "" why don't we fight for taxation with representation together?   


If we all seem to agree democrats / republicans are just different sides of the same coin then why don't we form a new party that represents our best interests and understands a fellow US citizen is a brother / sister and we are currently all in this together ( Unless you are just stupid rich )  so its about time we acted like it.   


Stop the divisivness that makes it easier for us to fight with eachother when we all have the same basic needs and are entitled to these needs as citizens.   


Say it with me "" NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION !""   
We need to bring the true meaning of the Gadsden flag back to our current day.

[**The False Front**](http://www.skybooksusa.com/time-travel/experime/thefalse.htm)  


Temporal anomalies are scattered throughout the world -- things that could not possibly belong to the time period in which they were found. Evidence exists of human civilization, artifacts and technology out of time that are abundant, well researched and well documented.  


This forbidden knowledge is being protected and hidden from all of us.

Today’s popular view of modern human presence in the distant past is a false front. The real truth is out there showing proof of advanced technology and people millions of years before humanity is stated to have evolved on the planet.

&gt;Why has the scientific establishment and government suppressed and ignored these remarkable finds?  
Where did they come from?  
How did they get there?  
Why are we suppressing this suggestive proof of modern time travelers visiting our past?

As you study the forbidden knowledge on these pages a whole new truth will emerge and become apparent to you... the truth that the earth was visited or inhabited by modern humans using advanced technology long before the appearance of the first humans as the history books write today.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/3rfb2lg1end41.gif

 

The chart above presents the accepted scientific view of evolution on this planet... It shows human beings appearing on the earth about 1.6 million years ago, and human civilization just 10,000 years ago.  


However, using accepted scientific methods numerous finds show conclusive proof of modern humans and advanced civilizations present or visiting the earth’s past long before this timeline represents as possible. The proof is shocking! Scientific proof of visitors, possibly time travelers, long before civilized man evolved on the planet.  


From where, or perhaps ""when,"" were advanced civilizations visiting our past thousands or millions of years before man appeared on the earth?

As we move further back in time through the different eras, you will see evidence continue to grow... evidence showing proof of modern humans and technology in the distant past.

[**Cenozoic Era Proof**](http://www.skybooksusa.com/time-travel/experime/cenozoic.htm)  


The *Cenozoic Era* is last of the five major eras of geologic time, beginning about 65 million years ago and extending through the present.

It follows the *Cretaceous* period of the *Mesozoic* era and is subdivided into the Tertiary period and the Quaternary period. Features of Tertiary times are considered in articles under the names of the various shorter time periods (epochs) making up the Tertiary period; in order, from earliest to latest, these are the *Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene,* and *Pliocene.*  


The accepted scientific view of evolution in the Cenozoic Era shows human beings appearing on the earth about 1.6 million years ago, and human civilization just 10,000 years ago.

Yet the scientific finds presented below present a very shocking and different story.  
 

 

**Pleistocene Epoch Finds**

\- Copper Coin from Illinois, over 200,000 years old  
This rendition of a *coin-like object*, from a well boring near *Lawn Ridge*, *Illinois*, was found at a depth of about 114 feet below the surface.

According to the information supplied by the Illinois State Geological Survey, the deposits containing the coin are between 200,000 and 400,000 years old...

Who left this coin hundreds of thousands of years before civilized man evolved?  


&amp;#x200B;

\- **Modern Human Skeleton from Tanzania, over 800,000 years old**  
In 1913 Professor **Hans Reck**, of Berlin University, conducted investigations at *Olduvai Gorge* in *Tanzania*, then German East Africa.

During his stay at Olduvai Gorge, Reck found a modern human skeleton that remains a source of mystery and controversy to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4ty23xp7end41.jpg?width=257&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26b8110fdfe57f17e27b20609c865c434130bda9

 

This modern skull is from a fully human skeleton found that year. The human skeletal remains, including this complete skull, were cemented in the rock and had to be chipped with hammers and chisels. It was found in the upper end of a rock bed dated at more than 1,000,000 years old.

How did this modern human find his way 1,000,000 years into the past?

&amp;#x200B;

**- Willendorf Venus Statue, over 30,000 years old**

The Willendorf Venus, from Europe, dated at 30,000 years old. Who created or left this artifact nearly 20,000 years before human civilization appeared?

**-** **Modern Human Skull in Buenos Aires, over 1,000,000 years old**  
In **1896**, workers excavating a dry dock in ***Buenos Aires*** found a modern human skull. The *Pre-Ensenadan stratum* in which the Buenos Aires skull was found is a least 1.0 - 1.5 million years old.

&amp;#x200B;

Even at 1 million years the presence of a fully modern human skull anywhere in the world is highly anomalous.

Why and how did a modern human *arrive in Buenos Aires over 1,000,000 years ahead of its time?*

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Pliocene Epoch Finds**

 

**-** **Figurines from Nampa, Idaho, about 2 million years old**  
A small human image, skillfully formed in clay, was found in 1889 at *Nampa*, *Idaho*.

The figurine came from the the 300-foot level of a well boring and dated to be of the Plio-Pleistocene age, about 2 million years old. **G. F. Wright** noted,

&gt;""The image is about an inch and a half long; and remarkable for the perfection with which it represents the human form... It was a female figure, and had the lifelike lineaments in the parts which were finished that would do credit to the classic centers of art.""

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;Upon showing the object to Professor F. W. Putnam,"" wrote Wright, ""he at once directed attention to the character of the incrustations of iron upon the surface as indicative of a relic of considerable antiquity. There were patches of anhydrous red oxide of iron in protected places upon it, such as could not have been formed upon any fraudulent object.""

Humans had not even evolved on this planet two million years ago. *So who created or left this artifact in earth’s distant past?*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 **-** **Modern Human Skull found in Italy, over 3 - 4 million years old**  
Late in the summer of 1860, Professor **Giuseppe Ragazzoni**, a geologist and teacher at the Technical Institute of Brescia, traveled to the nearby locale of *Castenedolo*, about 10 kilometers southeast of *Brescia*, to gather fossil shells in the Pliocene strata exposed in a pit at the base of a low hill, the *Colle de Vento*. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a1iazt2jend41.jpg?width=267&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15a7f5d559901691f6e53aab80144293c6a0afc5

&amp;#x200B;

 

Here he discovered this remarkable and anatomically modern human skull. The stratum from which it was taken is assigned to the *Astian stage of the Pliocene*.

According to modern authorities, the Astian belongs to the Middle Pliocene, which would give the skull an age of 3 - 4 million years.

*Why and how did this modern human visit* ***Italy*** *nearly two million years before human beings walked the planet?*  


&amp;#x200B;

**-** **Carved Shell from the Red Crag, England, between 2.0 and 2.5 million years old**  
In a report delivered to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1881, **H. Stopes**, *F.G.S.* (*Fellow of the Geological Society*), described a shell, the surface of which bore a carving of a crude but unmistakably human face. The carved shell was found in the stratified deposits of the Red Crag.

The *Red Crag*, part of which is called the *Walton Crag*, is dated to be of Late Pliocene age between 2.0 and 2.5 million years old. This find would place intelligent beings in England as far back as 2.0 million and maybe as much as 2.5 million years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6lcyuosmend41.jpg?width=301&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=250f51c767b76274650dba658b579f99fe716d93

 

One should keep in mind that in terms of conventional paleoanthropoligical opinion, one does not encounter such works of art until the time of fully *modern Cro-Magnon man* in the Late Pleistocene, about 30,000 years ago.

*What visitor to Earth’s distant past carved and left this shell?*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Eocene Epoch Finds**  
 

&amp;#x200B;

**-** **Chalk Ball near Laon, France, 45 - 55 million years old**  
The April 1862 edition of *The Geologist* included an English translation of an intriguing report by **Maximilien Melleville**, the vice president of the *Societe Academique of Laon* , France.

This chalk ball was discovered in an Early Eocene lignite bed. On the basis of its stratigraphic position, is has been assigned a date of 45 - 55 million years ago.

According to Melleville, there was no possibility that the chalk ball was a forgery:

&gt;""It really is penetrated over four-fifths of its height by a *black bituminous color* that merges toward the top into a yellow circle, and which is evidently due to the contact of the lignite in which it had been for so long a time plunged. The upper part, which was in contact with the shell bed, on the contrary has preserved its natural color -- the dull white of the chalk.... As to the rock in which it was found, I can affirm that it is perfectly virgin, and presents no trace whatever of any ancient exploitation.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1c8targqend41.jpg?width=267&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a6810e8d7cf3c0bfa01279c26d0530ffc6eed3f

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;As extraordinary as it might seem to those attached to standard evolutionary views, the evidence associated in this find suggest that if humans made the ball, they must have been in France 45 - 55 million years ago.

*Who made and left this man made artifact in our past long before human evolution... even before grazing and carnivorous mammals walked the planet?*

&amp;#x200B;

 

**-** **Mortar and Pestle in California, up to 55 million years old**  
In 1877 Mr. **J. H. Neale** was superintendent of the *Montezuma Tunnel Company*, and ran the Montezuma tunnel into the gravel underlying the lava of *Table Mountain, Tuolumne County*...

At a distance of between 1400 and 1500 feet from the mouth of the tunnel, or of between 200 and 300 feet beyond the edge of the solid lava, Mr. Neale saw several spear-heads of some dark rock and nearly one foot in length.

On exploring further, he himself found a small mortar three or four inches in diameter and of irregular shape.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8bxtmdgtend41.jpg?width=171&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdeeaaa0460fe8ae3a67b973e1c1d38decda8d8d

&amp;#x200B;

 

This was discovered within a foot or two of the spear-heads.

He then found a large well-formed pestle and near by a large and very regular mortar. All of these relics were found the same afternoon, and were all within a few feet of one another and close to the bed-rock, perhaps within a foot of it. Mr. Neale declares that it is utterly impossible that these relics can have reached the position in which they were found excepting at the time the gravel was deposited, and before the lava cap formed.

The position of the artifacts in gravel close to the bed-rock at *Tuolumne Table Mountain* indicates they were 33-55 million years old. Grazing and carnivorous mammals had not even evolved on the planet at this time.

*So who brought and left behind these artifacts in California nearly 50 million years ago?*  
 

&amp;#x200B;

 **-** **Sling Stone from Bramford, England, 5 - 50 million years old**  
This sling stone is from the detritus bed beneath the Red Crag at *Bramford*, *England*. At least Pliocene in age, the stone is at least 5 million and possibly up to 50 million years old. Upon examination it was obvious that the stone had been shaped by the hand of man.... 

&amp;#x200B;

The whole surface... has been scraped with a flint, in such a way that it is covered with a series of facets running fairly regularly from end to end.... The scraping described above covers the whole surface of the object, and penetrates into its irregularities.

As it stands the object is entirely artificial... yet left in a time millions of years before humans had had even evolved on the Earth.

[**Mesozoic Era Proof**](http://www.skybooksusa.com/time-travel/experime/mesozoic.htm)  


The *Mesozoic Era* is one of the major divisions of geological history, following the Paleozoic era and preceding the Cenozoic era.

The Mesozoic era, which lasted from approximately 240 million to 65 million years ago, may be characterized as the Age of Reptiles because their greatest development occurred during this era. The first birds and mammals and the first flowering plants also appeared at this time. The Mesozoic era is divided into three time periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous.  


As we move back into time we enter a period in the *Mesozoic Era* that began with the first dinosaurs appearing on the earth and ending with the development of flowering plants. Humans wouldn’t evolve for at least another 136 million years.

Yet the scientific finds below suggest proof that advanced civilizations were visiting Earth’s past and walking at a time when dinosaurs roamed the planet.

 

**Cretaceous Period**  
 

**-** **Metallic Tube at Saint-Jean de Livet, France over 65 million years old**  
**Y. Druet** and **H. Salfati** announced in 1968 the discovery of semi-ovoid metallic tubes of identical shape but varying size in Cretaceous chalk.

The chalk bed, exposed in a quarry at *Saint-Jean de Livet*, *France*, is estimated to be least 65 million years old.

**Triassic Period**  
 

**-** **Shoe Sole from Nevada, dated at 213 - 248 million years ago**  
On October 8, 1922, the American Weekly section of the New York Sunday American ran a prominent feature titled ""*Mystery of the Petrified ’Shoe Sole*,"" by Dr. **W. H. Ballou**.

Ballou wrote:

&gt;""Some time ago, while he was prospecting for fossils in ***Nevada***, **John T. Reid**, a distinguished mining engineer and geologist, stopped suddenly and looked down in utter bewilderment and amazement at a rock near his feet. For there, a part of the rock itself, was what seemed to be a human footprint!  
   
Closer inspection showed that it was not a mark of a naked foot, but was, apparently, a shoe sole which had been turned into stone.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zui8gr22fnd41.jpg?width=267&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eee9271c95c70577d094e6d343745c36a5072908

 

&gt;The forepart was missing.  
   
But there was the outline of at least two-thirds of it, and around this outline ran a well-defined sewn thread which had, it appeared, attached the welt to the sole. Further on was another line of sewing, and in the center, where the foot would have rested had the object really been a shoe sole, there was an indentation, exactly such as would have been made by the bone of the heel rubbing upon and wearing down the material of which the sole had been made.

**Reid** got hold of a microphotographer and an analytical chemist of the *Rockefeller Institute*, who made photos and analyses of the specimen. The analyses removed any doubt of the shoe sole having been subjected to Triassic fossilization....

The microphoto magnifications are twenty times larger than the specimen itself, showing the minutest detail of thread twist and warp, proving conclusively that the shoe sole is not a resemblance, but is strictly the handiwork of man. Even to the naked eye the threads can be seen distinctly, along with the definitely symmetrical outlines of the shoe sole. Inside this rim and running parallel to it is a line which appears to be regularly perforated as if for stitches.

The Triassic rock bearing the fossil shoe sole is now recognized as being *dated at 213 - 248 million years old*. An obviously modern shoe, complete with stitching, and etched in time in ancient Triassic rock.

*What modern visitor was walking in our distant past more than 210 million years ago before the age of the dinosaurs?*  


[**Paleozoic Era Proof**](http://www.skybooksusa.com/time-travel/experime/paleozoi.htm)  


The ***Paleozoic Era*** is a major division of geological time, preceded by Precambrian time and followed by the Mesozoic era, and including the *Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous,* and *Permian* periods. The Paleozoic Era began about 570 million years ago and ended about 240 million years ago.  


As we move back even further in time we enter this period of the ***Paleozoic Era*** where life was evolving from primitive, multicellular, free-floating forms in the sea to advanced groups on land. The most advanced life forms at the end of this period where amphibians, insects, fern forests, and small reptiles. Humans would not evolve for nearly another 300 million years.

Yet the scientific finds below again suggest even more strongly that modern humans with advanced technology were visiting Earth’s past and walking at a time when the first life forms were just beginning to emerge on our planet.  
 

**Carboniferous Period**  
 

\- Gold Thread in England, between 320 - 360 million years old  
On June 22, 1844, this curious report appeared in the London Times:

&gt;""A few days ago, as some workmen were employed in quarrying a rock close to the Tweed about a quarter of a mile below Rutherford-mill, a ***gold thread*** was discovered embedded in the stone at a depth of eight feet.""

Dr. **A. W. Medd** of the British Geological Survey wrote in 1985 that this stone is of *Early Carboniferous* age between 320 and 360 million years old.

*Who dropped this gold thread in the ancient fern forests in a distant time when the most advanced life forms on the planet where amphibians and insects?*

 

\- Gold Chain from Morrisonville, Illinois, 260 - 320 million years old  
On June 11, 1891, *The Morrisonville Times* reported:

&gt;""A curious find was brought to light by Mrs. **S. W. Culp** last Tuesday morning. As she was breaking a lump of coal preparatory to putting it in the scuttle, she discovered, as the lump fell apart, embedded in a circular shape a small gold chain about ten inches in length of antique and quaint workmanship.  
   
At first Mrs. Culp thought the chain had been dropped accidentally in the coal, but as she undertook to lift the chain up, the idea of its having been recently dropped was at once made fallacious, for as the lump of coal broke it separated almost in the middle, and the circular position of the chain placed the two ends near to each other, and as the lump separated, the middle of the chain became loosened while each end remained fastened to the coal.  
&gt;  
&gt;The lump of coal from which this chain was taken is supposed to come from the ***Taylorville*** or ***Pana mines*** (southern ***Illinois***) and almost hushes one’s breath with mystery when it is thought for how many long ages the earth has been forming strata after strata which hid the golden links from view. The chain was an eight-carat gold and weighed eight penny-weights.""

The *Illinois State Geological Survey* has said the coal in which the gold chain was found is 260 - 320 million years old. This raises the possibility that culturally advanced human beings were present or visiting in North America during that time.

*How did this gold chain find itself left behind in Earth’s distant past more than a quarter of a billion years before humans had evolved?*  
 

\- Carved Stone near Webster, Iowa, 260 - 320 million years old  
The April 2,1897 edition of the *Daily News of Omaha*, Nebraska, carried an article titled ""*Carved Stone Buried in a Mine*,"" which described an object from a mine near ***Webster City, Iowa***.

The article stated:

&gt;""While mining coal today in the Lehigh coal mine, at a depth of 130 feet, one of the miners came upon a piece of rock which puzzles him and he was unable to account for its presence at the bottom of the coal mine. The stone is of a dark grey color and about two feet long, one foot wide and four inches in thickness.  
   
Over the surface of the stone, which is very hard, lines are drawn at angles forming perfect diamonds. The center of each diamond is a fairly good ***face of an old man*** having a peculiar indentation in the forehead that appears in each of the pictures, all of them being remarkably alike. Of the faces, all but two are looking to the right.

*Was this stone carved and left behind by a traveler from earth’s future?*  


\- Iron Cup from Oklahoma Coal Mine, 312 million years old  
On November 27, 1948 the following statement was made by **Frank J. Kenwood** in *Sulphur Springs*, ***Arkansas***.

&gt;""While I was working in the Municipal Electric Plant in Thomas, ***Oklahoma*** in 1912, I came upon a solid chunk of coal which was too large to use. I broke it with a sledge hammer. This iron pot fell from the center leaving the impression mould of the pot in the piece of coal.  
   
Jim Stall (an employee of the company) witnessed the breaking of the coal, and saw the pot fall out. I traced the source of the coal, and found that it came from the *Wilburton, Oklahoma, Mines*. According to Robert O. Fay of the *Oklahoma Geological Survey*, the Wilburton mine coal is about 312 million years old.

*What advanced civilization or visitor was creating or using iron pots in our past more than 300 million years ago?*  


\- Block Wall in an Oklahoma Mine, at least 286 million years old  
**W.W. McCormick** of Abilene, Texas, reported his grandfather’s account of a stone block wall that was found deep within a coal mine:

&gt;""In the year 1928, I, Atlas Almon Mathis, was working in coal mine No. 5., located two miles north of Heavener, Oklahoma. This was a shaft mine, and they told us it was two miles deep. The mine was so deep that they let us down into it on an elevator.... They pumped air down to us, it was so deep."" One evening, Mathis was blasting coal loose by explosives in ""room 24"" of this mine.  
   
""The next morning,"" said Mathis, ""there were several concrete blocks laying in the room. These blocks were 12-inch cubes and were so smooth and polished on the outside that all six sides could serve as mirrors. Yet they were full of gravel, because I chipped one of them open with my pick, and it was plain concrete inside.""  
   
Mathis added: ""As I started to timber the room up, it caved in; and I barely escaped. When I came back after the cave-in, a solid wall of these polished blocks was left exposed. About 100 to 150 yards farther down our air core, another miner struck this same wall, or one very similar.""

The coal in the mine was *Carboniferous*, which would mean the wall was at least 286 million years old. According to Mathis, the mining company officers immediately pulled the men out of the mine and forbade them to speak about what they had seen. Mathis said the *Wilburton miners* also told of finding ""a solid block of silver in the shape of a barrel... with the prints of the staves on it,"" in an area of coal dating between 280 and 320 million years ago.

*What advance civilization built this wall?... Why was the truth, as is so many of these cases protected and hidden?... What is the real truth about time travelers, modern humans, and modern technology in our past?*  
 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Hieroglyphics in Ohio Coal Mine, 260 million year old  
It is reported that **James Parsons**, and his two sons, exhumed a slate wall in a coal mine at *Hammondville*, ***Ohio***, in 1868. It was a large smooth wall, disclosed when a great mass of coal fell away from it, and on its surface, carved in bold relief, were several lines of hieroglyphics.

*Who carved these hieroglyphics more than 250 years before humans walked the earth?*  
 

**Devonian Period**  
 

\- Nail in Devonian Sandstone, between 360 and 408 million years old  
In 1844, Sir **David Brewster** reported that a nail had been discovered firmly embedded in a block of sandstone from the *Kingoodie* (*Mylnfield*) *Quarry* in *North Britain*. 

Dr. **A. W. Medd** of the British Geological Survey recently indicated that this sandstone is of ""*Lower Old Red Sandstone age*"" (Devonian, between 360 and 408 million years old). In his report to the *British Association for the Advancement of Science*, **Brewster** stated:

&gt;""The particular block in which the nail was found, was nine inches thick, and in proceeding to clear the rough rock for dressing, the point of the nail was found projecting about half an inch (quite eaten with rust) into the ’till,’ the rest of the nail lying along the surface of the stone to within an inch of the head, which went right down into the body of the stone.""

The fact that the head of the nail was buried in the sandstone block would seem to rule out the possibility the nail had been pounded into the block after it was quarried. This was a time where amphibians and insects were the only dominant life form on our planet.

*So who dropped this nail to have it eventually preserved in rock at a time more than 350 million years before humans appeared?*  
 

**Cambrian Period**  
 

\- Shoe Print in Utah Shale, 505 to 590 Million Years Old  
In 1968, **William J. Meister**, a draftsman and amateur trilobite collector, reported finding a shoe print in the Wheeler Shale near *Antelope Spring*, ***Utah***.

This *shoe-like indentation* and its cast were revealed when Meister split open a block of shale.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7mpd9n15fnd41.jpg?width=327&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08018f5c8a16b38ef8c188cb853b2a624a81b66b

 

Clearly visible within the imprint were the remains of trilobites, extinct marine arthropods. The shale holding the print and the trilobite fossils is from the *Cambrian*, and would thus be 505 to 590 million years old.

Meister described the ancient shoe-like impression in an article that appeared in the *Creation Research Society Quarterly:*

&gt;""The heel print was indented in the rock about an eighth of an inch more than the sole. The footprint was clearly that of the right foot because the sandal was well worn on the right side of the heel in the characteristic fashion.""

At this time in our planet’s history there was no plant or animal life on the land, even the most early types of fish swimming in the seas had not yet evolved. It must have been a very barren landscape that this visitor to Earth’s past saw as he walked the land.

*How did he arrive so far into our past?*  
 

 

**Pre-Cambrian Period**  
 

**-** **Metallic Vase from Pre-Cambrian Rock, over 600 Million Years Old**  
The following report, titled ""*A Relic of a Bygone Age*,"" appeared in the magazine Scientific American (June 5, 1852):

&gt;""A few days ago a powerful blast was made in the rock at *Meeting House Hill*, in ***Dorchester***, a few rods south of **Rev. Mr. Hall**’s meeting house. The blast threw out an immense mass of rock, some of the pieces weighing several tons, and scattered fragments in all directions. Among them was picked a metallic vessel in two parts, rent asunder by the explosion. On putting the parts together it formed a *bell-shaped vessel*, 4-1/2 inches high, 6-1/2 inches at the base, 2-1/2 inches at the top, and about an eighth of an inch in thickness.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hoj9eba7fnd41.jpg?width=164&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1797ed7a8e2b3f57bad78915b862722b0819ad1a

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;The body of this vessel resembles zinc in color, or a composition metal, in which there is a considerable portion of silver. On the side there are six figures of a flower, or bouquet, beautifully inlaid with pure silver, and around the lower part of the vessel a vine, or wreath, also inlaid with silver.  
   
The chasing, carving, and inlaying are exquisitely done by the art of some cunning workman. This curious and unknown vessel was blown out of the solid pudding stone, fifteen feet below the surface.""

According to a recent U.S. Geological Survey map of the Boston-Dorchester area, the pudding stone, now called the *Roxbury conglomerate*, is of Precambrian age, over 600 million years old. By standard accounts, life was just beginning to form on this planet during the Precambrian.

But in ***the Dorchester vessel*** we have evidence indicating the presence of artistic metal workers in North America over 600 million years before **Leif Erikson**. At this time in our planets history the was no life on land, plant or animal. The most advance life-form at this barren time in our planets history was simple algae floating in the seas. Yet somehow through time this beautiful work or art was brought and left behind and eventually buried and preserved in ancient rock.

*Did a time traveler from the earths future leave this behind in the hopes of later discovery... in an attempt to help ensure that the truth about time travel would one day be revealed?*

**-** **Grooved Sphere from South Africa, 2.8 Billion Years Old**  
Over the past several decades, *South African miners* have found hundreds of metallic spheres, at least one of which has three parallel grooves running around its equator.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ki1es6uafnd41.jpg?width=261&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0235bd2d43279b70961451543e7f32add3ecc93

 

The spheres are of two types

&gt;""one of solid bluish metal with white flecks, and another which is a hollow ball filled with a white spongy center.""

**Roelf Marx**, curator of the museum of *Klerksdorp*, ***South Africa***, where some of the spheres are housed, said:

&gt;""The spheres are a complete mystery. They look man-made, yet at the time in Earth’s history when they came to rest in this rock no intelligent life existed. The globes are found in *pyrophyllite*, which is mined near the little town of *Ottosdal* in the ***Western Transvaal***. This pyrophyllite is a quite soft secondary mineral with a count of only 3 on the Mohs’ scale and was formed by sedimentation about 2.8 billion years ago. On the other hand the globes are very hard and cannot be scratched, even by steel.""

The sphere with the three parallel grooves around it are too perfect to be anything but man made. The Precambrian mineral deposit where the globes are found is dated to be at least 2.8 billion years old. At this time simple microscopic cells were all that was alive on the earth.

But this is obviously not true.

Who created or left behind these magnificent spheres. Obviously man made, and stronger than steel, what was their purpose for the people who visited and left them behind in time?  


[**Other Finds**](http://www.skybooksusa.com/time-travel/experime/other.htm)  
 

**-** **Artifacts From AIX En Provence, France**  
In his book *Mineralogy*, **Count Bournon** recorded an intriguing discovery that had been made by French workmen in the latter part of the eighteenth century.

Bournon wrote:

&gt;""During the years 1786, 1787, and 1788, they were occupied near *AIX en Provence*, in ***France***, in quarrying stone for the rebuilding , upon a vast scale, of the Palace of Justice. The stone was a limestone of deep grey, and of that kind which are tender when they come out of the quarry, but harden by exposure to the air.  
   
The strata were separated from one another by a bed of sand mixed with clay, more or less calcareous. The first which were wrought presented no appearance of any foreign bodies, but, after the workmen had removed the ten first beds, they were astonished, when taking away the eleventh, to find its inferior surface, at the depth of forty or fifty feet, covered with shells.  
   
The stone of this bed having been removed, as they were taking away a stratum of argillaceous sand, which separated the eleventh bed from the twelfth, they found stumps of columns and fragments of stone half wrought, and the stone was exactly similar to that of the quarry: they found moreover coins, handles of hammers, and other tools or fragments of tools in wood.  
   
But that which principally commanded their attention, was a board about one inch thick and seven or eight feet long; it was broken into many pieces, of which none were missing, and it was possible to join them again one to another, and to restore to the board or plate its original form, which was that of the boards of the same kind used by the masons and quarry men: it was worn in the same manner, rounded and waving upon the edges.""

**Count Bournon**, continuing his description, stated:

&gt;""The stones which were completely or partly wrought, had not at all changed in their nature, but the ***fragments of the board***, and ***the instruments***, and pieces of instruments of wood, had been changed into ***agate***, which was very fine and agreeably colored. Here then, we have the traces of a work executed by the hand of man, placed at a depth of fifty feet, and covered with eleven beds of compact limestone: everything tended to prove that this work had been executed upon the spot where the traces existed.

*The presence of man had then preceded the formation of this stone.*  
 

\- Letter-like Shapes in Marble, Philadelphia  
In 1830, letter-like shapes were discovered within a solid block of marble from a quarry 12 miles northwest of ***Philadelphia***. The marble block was taken from a depth of 60-70 feet.

&amp;#x200B;

 

This was reported in the American Journal of Science (vol. 19, 1831, p. 361). The quarry workers removed layers of gneiss, mica slate, [hornblende](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornblende), talcose slate, and primitive clay slate before coming to the layer from which the block containing the letter-like shapes were cut.

While they were sawing through the block, the workmen happened to notice a rectangular indentation, about 1.5 inches wide by .625 inches high, displaying two ***raised characters***.

Several respectable gentlemen from nearby *Norristown*, ***Pennsylvania***, were called to the scene and inspected the object. It is hard to explain the formation of the characters as products of natural physical processes.

*This suggests the characters were made by intelligent humans in the distant past.*",conspiracy,Forbidden Knowledge Mega Thread  pictures  illustrations

The completion of the city is comparable to digging out a system of below ground chambers inhabitable for 20,000 people with just a hammer and chisel. It is suspected the city was used as a huge bunker to protect its occupants from possible natural disaster or war.

Amazingly, the community had accessible fresh water, shops, individual rooms, community rooms, tombs, escape routes, arsenals, livestock, and even a school sporting a study room.

A prehistoric, below grown, three-level, stone monument on the island of Malta is known as the [Hypogeum of Hal-Saflieni](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/arqueologia/esp_malta02.htm) and was uncovered in 1902.

Finding it was an accident: several laborers fell through a hole they were digging.

In addition, 7,000 skeletal remains were discovered. Unbeknownst to anyone is the time period Hypogeum of Hal-Saflieni was built, but it is made completely from megalithic stones.

To make matters even more strange, voices in the range 95 to 120 Hz can echo throughout the whole complex when a person is standing in a certain spot.

Essentially this means that women's voices often don't produce this effect in the same way that men's voices do.

If that's not strange enough, a man with a voice range at about 110 Hz, the whole dwelling becomes a room that induces trance-like states and appears to be able to stimulate the creative center of the human brain.

Around 2,000 feet long, the [Great Dam of Marib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marib_Dam) was almost twice as long as the Hoover Dam.

In about 600 A.D, the dam collapsed and burst, ruining most of the agriculture system and turning the area into the sandy spot it can be seen as today.

**Introduction**

For many years there have been reports and rumors of a vast network of underground complexes and tunnels beneath the North American continent. Starting in the late 1980s, the American government has tried to deflect these rumors through a campaign of misdirection and misinformation. Disclosure of the [Greenbrier Congressional Shelter](http://www.bvalphaserver.com/ftopicp-480224.html) at White Sulphur Springs is a good example of this campaign.

To believe the existence of the Greenbrier complex was revealed against the wishes of the American government is the height of naiveté. This revelation was allowed to take place. The Greenbrier underground complex was no longer useful, so it was sacrificed to divert attention away from a much larger secret. In other words, a classic misdirection ploy.  


While I do not have complete knowledge concerning the extent of America's covert underground infrastructure, I do have detailed first hand experience with many sites near my home in Oregon. Based on my experiences, and assuming a roughly uniform distribution correlated with U.S. population demographics, the total number of covert underground facilities is in the tens of thousands.  


What follows is both a compendium of my observations, and a do-it-your-self field guide for those who wish discover the true extent of the American covert underground infrastructure.  


**Rabbit holes**

The covert underground infrastructure serves many functions. Among these are strategic storage of materials and weapons, clandestine research and production facilities, alternant basing for military personnel and equipment, surface environment control systems (atmospheric lensing, synthetic earthquakes, weather modification, civilian population control, etc.), and of course sheltering essential government personnel during time of national crisis or war. This list is not complete, it is only indicative of the diverse ways in which the underground infrastructure is utilized.  


It should be obvious that many of the uses listed above require both support from, and easy access to, the surrounding surface communities. I call these underground access points ""rabbit holes"", and they represent a key detectable feature of the underground infrastructure.  


It should also be obvious that many of these uses require the facilities to be interconnected by a network of tunnels. The construction of these tunnels creates surface evidence of their existence, albeit transitory.

From the perspective of detection, the transitory nature of the evidence makes tunnel construction less useful than covert underground access points, however as we shall see, the evidence itself is far more compelling.  


**Searching for Alice**

As previously mentioned, many underground infrastructure functions require surface access, furthermore many underground facilities also make use of above ground support such as electrical utilities, generally as backup for their primary supply source. These requirements pose a design dilemma. The underground access points must be well hidden, and at the same time, easily accessible to personnel and/or vehicular traffic. What is true of covert underground access points, is also true to a lesser extent for utility supply points.  


How do you hide traffic and personnel movement? By mixing it with a legitimate flow of people and vehicles, in locations already under government ownership or control. In rural areas, public parks and recreational facilities make ideal locations. For instance, at a public camp ground, who will notice if 20 cars go in, but only 15 come out? In urban areas, post offices and other purpose built government installations are used.

After all, who pays attention to the comings and goings at a post office? In other words, the underground access points are hidden in plain sight. This is both a strength and a weakness. It is a strength if nobody is paying close attention, however it is also tremendous weakness, since anyone wishing to observe the location will blend in to the general ebb and flow of activity. In some respects, rural underground access points are easier to locate, but more dangerous to investigate, since the level of human activity will be less.  


Another aspect of *rabbit hole location* is proximity to some useful above ground resource. For instance, a public zoo makes a good source of genetic material for a bio-lab facility. It should be obvious that a major metropolitan hospital would make an ideal source for human genetic material, as well as the perfect location to ""field test"" some new weapon-ized bacteria or virus. What is true of urban access points, is also true for rural access points.

Many are located near the periphery of major urban populations. A large water reservoir, or a public camp ground located near a major highway, are good examples of useful above ground resources. Rural underground access points are favored as utility supply points, since the supply is less likely to be interrupted in time of national crisis.

As we shall see, this last observation can be used to great advantage in detecting rabbit hole locations.  


**Urban rabbit hole detection**

The detection of urban access points requires both persistence, and a certain amount of luck. Quite often, it will be some apparently trivial detail that will be your first clue.

The following is a list of indicators that are cause for suspicion:

&amp;#x200B;

1. A post office parking lot full of cars, with only one or two people visible inside the post office.
2. Sporadic late night activity at a government office building.
3. Security that is out of proportion with presumed facility use.
4. Unbalanced traffic patterns. Example: people or vehicles go in but do not come out, or visa versa.
5. Facility size is out of proportion to traffic flow. Example: many delivery vehicles at a small government office building.
6. Utility services is out of proportion to facility size. Example: large electrical service supplying a small government office building.
7. Deliveries are mismatched to presumed facility use. Example: 40 foot refrigerated truck, or medical supply truck unloading at social security office.
8. Facility location is inappropriate for presumed use or function. Example: social security office located in an industrial district.
9. Facility construction and/or layout is inappropriate for presumed use. Example: office building with oversized warehouse style loading dock.
10. Facility staff size and/or type is inappropriate for presumed facility use or function. Example: large ratio of managerial personnel (business suites) to clerical personnel.

The above list is far from exhaustive. R

ather, the list is intended to illustrate what sort of details should be examined to *uncover a rabbit hole*. As can be seen from the list, many clues involve some activity that does not match the presumed use or function of the facility. Other clues involve a mismatch between the physical nature of the facility and it's presumed function.  


Once a suspected rabbit hole has been located, further observation is required to develop a profile of anomalous activity. Drive by the location at different times of the day and night. Keep detailed records of observations. Enlist the help of individuals who live within sight of the facility to monitor activity.

Does a medical supply truck show up every Tuesday at a social security office? Is there any discernable pattern to the traffic flow imbalance?

It is the details that will ultimately confirm the existence of a suspected rabbit hole.  


**Rural rabbit hole detection**

As with urban access points, it will be a mismatch between activity and/or the physical nature of a facility, and it's presumed use or function that will indicate the presence of a rural underground access point. In addition, there are several aspects of rural underground access points that appear to be unique.

Most rural underground access points employ a form of radiated electro-magnet field that functions as a wide area deterrent to birds, rodents, and insects. The purpose of the field being to act as a contamination shield or barrier for the underground access point entrance. Next, since rural underground access points receive less intense public scrutiny, their supporting above ground infrastructure is generally speaking, more blatant.

The presence of a well maintained home with around the clock human supervision of the suspected facility is common feature. These homes will have multiple satellite dishes, and/or radio antennas. Another common feature of rural rabbit holes is the presence of odd alpha-numeric markings on the reverse side of highway traffic signs located near the underground access point.  


The following is a list of rural underground access point indicators.

&amp;#x200B;

1. A well maintained branch road leading to a little used park or recreational facility.
2. Electrical power lines that are routed near facility, when such routing results in longer line length and/or routing over a natural obstacle (mountain, river, etc.).
3. Electrical power lines or substations much larger than visible local load requirements.
4. Large reservoirs that serve no apparent useful function. Example: not needed for flood control or civilian water supply, or that have larger capacity than is required for presumed function.
5. The presence of truck traffic on rural roads with no known destination, or inappropriate truck types for apparent destination.
6. A public park or recreational facility that is maintained at a level well in excess of other nearby facilities, especially if facility less well known or used than other nearby facilities.
7. Public facility personnel (park rangers, etc.) that are overly nosey and/or suspicious of your activities, especially if personnel occupy the site on a 24/7 basis.
8. Public park or recreational facility where part of facility is fenced off, or accessed by a gated road, or otherwise made inaccessible to the general public.
9. The presence of inappropriate or unusual structures and/or construction methods. Examples: small cinder block building with an electrical power feed normally used on major office buildings. An unmarked, but well maintained trail in public park. An old building (possibly abandoned) with a new door, and expensive lock.
10. People at camp grounds that seem out of place. Example: improperly dressed, or using inappropriate equipment, or having unusual accents (these are people taking a recreational break from underground facilities).
11. Well maintained roads that are not shown on maps, or follow a different route than shown on maps.
12. A noticeable lack of wildlife (birds, small animals, insects, etc.) in a location that would normally support a large wildlife population (see 1.2.4 preface).
13. Any of the applicable indicators listed under urban rabbit hole detection. Example: unbalanced traffic flows, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As with urban rabbit hole detection, this list is far from complete. It is intended to illustrate what sort of indicators to look for, when searching for rural underground access points. Again, all of the techniques employed in urban rabbit hole discovery are applicable to rural underground access points.

However, it must be stressed that rural access point detection and observation is far more dangerous. Not only are there less people to hide your activities, but a larger faction of those people who are present will likely be *rabbit hole* occupants or guardians. Failure to exercise due caution may lead to becoming an unwilling underground guest.

For this reason, the author suggests one or more of the following precautions.

1. Be very discreet in rural underground access point observation.
2. Always inform a trusted friend of your intended destination and expected time of return.
3. When possible, use a group recreational outing as cover for your activities.
4. Spread your observation activities over several months, at random times and days of the week.
5. Assume you are being watched at all times, and act appropriately. i.e. As somebody who is enjoying a day in the park.  
 

**Tunnel construction**

The techniques used for *covert tunnel construction* are very different than *civilian tunnel construction*. Covert tunnel construction makes use of a [boring machine that actually melts earth and rock](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_underground01.htm) (by chemical valence disruption), thereby forming a glass like tunnel wall. This has several advantages over civilian tunnel boring methods.

From the perspective of secrecy, the biggest advantage is that little or no waste material (rock, dirt, etc.) is produced by the boring process, thereby alleviating the need for above ground disposal sites. Another advantage is that tunnels can be bored through lose rock, sand, etc. or other locations that would be unsuitable for civilian boring methods (for instance, a river bed). Large underground cavities are also constructed using this technique.  


Covert tunnel boring produces several phenomena that are detectable by surface observation. These phenomena are transitory, and will disappear shortly after tunnel completion. However the presence of these phenomena is unmistakable evidence that covert tunnel construction is taking place.  


The method used to melt earth and rock employs electro-magnetic energy to disrupt the chemical bonds within the material. This method produces little or no heat as a by product of the melting process, and is therefore very stealthy. However it does cause the evaporation of water to take place at an accelerated rate.

Since the method is electro-magnetic, there is a certain amount of ""leakage"" radiation, and this is detectable by the odd effect it produces on surface water. In particular, the *water will appear to rise from the ground as wisps of steam*, even though the ground is cold. This phenomena is very noticeable during rain storms on cold winter nights. The steam does not rise into the air, as it would if the ground was actually warm, but instead forms a layer just above the surface.  


Another side effect of *covert tunnel boring* is a peculiar rippling in road surfaces. This rippling is very slight, and most noticeable while driving at highway speed (55 mph). It is more heard than felt. What sets this ripple apart from normal highway bumps and imperfections is it's consistency. Assuming a constant driving speed, the ripple is perfectly constant. In some cases, the rippled road surface will continue for several miles, without the slightest change in pitch or intensity.  


The ""cold steam"" phenomena is only observable while covert tunnel boring is actually taking place. However the ""road ripple"" phenomena will persist for several weeks after covert tunnel boring is finished.

These phenomena are best observed late at night.  


**Forty trillion dollars**

Despite an ever increasing tax burden, the roads and bridges continue to decline, the cities continue to decay, social security and Medicare benefits continue to dwindle. Today with both husband and wife working full time jobs, the American standard of living is less than 1950 when the husband worked, and the wife stayed home.

In 1950, most government buildings were somewhat dilapidated, having a ""well used"" look about them, while most American homes were modern and well cared for. Today the cities are full of shinny new government office buildings, and many American homes look dilapidated and in need of repair. Government budgets and deficits continue their upward spiral, while the American family is learning how to ""make do"" with less.

Consumer prices continue to rise and wages continue to fall, as the American dream fades, replaced with the nightmarish specter of advancing middleclass poverty. Inexorably, despite every effort to reverse the trend, American wealth has been systematically striped from the people, and transferred to the government  


Something has gone horribly wrong in America.  


For the past several decades, there have been an unbroken chain of government scandals involving over billing and multiple invoicing for items ranging from toilet seats to bombers. Inevitably the media portray these scandals as unscrupulous corporations taking advantage of an inept government bureaucracy.

Sadly these incidents are more pervasive than media reporting indicates, and the truth is far more ominous than mere government incompetence or corporate greed. When the clandestine diversion of tax revenue was no longer sufficient to satisfy the requirements, a second method was instituted. American jobs were outsourced to other countries, thereby allowing the government to repatriate nearly 100% of product and/or service revenue through the foreign purchase of American government bonds.

Since the early 1960s, the American citizenry have been the unwitting victims of government fraud, perpetrated on a scale so vast that it staggers the imagination. When figured in 2004 dollars, the total amount exceeds **40 trillion dollars**.  


What did the American government and it's corporate accomplices do with this almost inconceivable wealth?  


The government has *built a entirely new underground civilization* beneath the abandoned factories, tattered homes, and crime ridden streets that litter the American landscape. In this new society, there is no poverty, no crime or illicit drug use. In this new society, healthcare is affordable, energy is free, public transport is efficient. And you, the American tax payer have paid for it all, without receiving any benefit whatsoever for your Herculean efforts.  


As to why this monstrous crime was committed against the American people, is the topic for a future paper. Suffice it to say, you will not like the motive, nor the eventual disposition planed for you and your loved ones...

An international research group has applied methods of theoretical physics to investigate the electromagnetic response of [the Great Pyramid](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_piramide.htm) to radio waves.

Scientists predicted that under resonance conditions, the pyramid can concentrate electromagnetic energy in its internal chambers and under the base. The research group plans to use these theoretical results to design nanoparticles capable of reproducing similar effects in the optical range.

Such [nanoparticles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle) may be used, for example, to develop sensors and highly efficient solar cells.

The study ([Electromagnetic Properties of the Great Pyramid - First Multipole Resonances and Energy Concentration](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/electromagnetic-properties-great-pyramid.pdf)) was published in the *Journal of Applied Physics*.  


While Egyptian pyramids are surrounded by many *""myths""* and *""legends""*, researchers have little scientifically reliable information about their physical properties.

Physicists recently took an interest in how the Great Pyramid would interact with [electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation) of a resonant length.

Calculations showed that in the resonant state, the pyramid can concentrate [electromagnetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_energy) in the its internal chambers as well as under its base, where the third *""unfinished"" chamber* is located.

&amp;#x200B;

[Propagation of electromagnetic waves inside the pyramids of Cheops at different lengths of radio waves \(from 200 to 400 meters\). The black rectangular position of the so-called King's Chamber. Credit: ITMO University, Laser Zentrum Hannover](https://preview.redd.it/gx0ll8msand41.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=698c7ba34e940c31ec0a28193ce4fb02a841bf1f)

 

These conclusions were derived on the basis of numerical modeling and analytical methods of physics.

&gt;The researchers first estimated that resonances in the pyramid can be induced by radio waves with a length ranging from 200 to 600 meters.  
   
Then they made a model of the electromagnetic response of the pyramid and calculated the extinction cross section. This value helps to estimate which part of the incident wave energy can be scattered or absorbed by the pyramid under resonant conditions.  
   
Finally, for the same conditions, the scientists obtained the electromagnetic field distribution inside the pyramid.

In order to explain the results, the scientists conducted a *multipole analysis*. This method is widely used in physics to study the interaction between a complex object and electromagnetic field.

The object scattering the field is replaced by a set of simpler sources of radiation:

&gt;[multipoles](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/multipole)...

The collection of multipole radiation coincides with the field scattering by an entire object.

Therefore, knowing the type of each multipole, it is possible to predict and explain the distribution and configuration of the scattered fields in the whole system.  


The Great Pyramid attracted the researchers while they were studying the interaction between light and dielectric nanoparticles. The scattering of light by nanoparticles depends on their size, shape and refractive index of the source material.

Varying these parameters, it is possible to determine the resonance scattering regimes and use them to develop devices for controlling light at the nanoscale.

&gt;""Egyptian pyramids have always attracted great attention.  
   
We as scientists were interested in them as well, so we decided to look at the Great Pyramid as a particle dissipating radio waves resonantly.  
   
Due to the lack of information about the physical properties of the pyramid, we had to use some assumptions.  
   
For example, we assumed that *there are no unknown cavities inside*, and the building material with the properties of an ordinary limestone is evenly distributed in and out of the pyramid.  
   
With these assumptions made, we obtained interesting results that can find important practical applications,"" says Dr. Sc. Andrey Evlyukhin, scientific supervisor and coordinator of the research.

Now, the scientists plan to use the results to reproduce similar effects at the nanoscale.

&gt;""Choosing a material with suitable electromagnetic properties, we can obtain pyramidal nanoparticles with a promise for practical application in nanosensors and effective solar cells,"" says Polina Kapitainova, Ph.D., a member of the Faculty of Physics and Technology of [ITMO University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITMO_University).",conspiracy,Study Reveals the Great Pyramid of Giza can Focus Electromagnetic energy

**from** [**ThothWeb**](http://www.thothweb.com/) **Website**  
 

 

This article takes a quick look at a controversial site in Illinois called *Burrows Cave.*

In 1982 a large quantity of epigraphic material was been found there by it’s discoverer, a gentleman by the name of **Russell Burrows**. What is claimed by Burrows certainly doesn’t seem to be readily digestible by *mainstream archeologists*, but that of course is neither here nor there.

It has been said that some of the artifacts found are somewhat reminiscent of the Davenport, Iowa, and Wilmington, Ohio, tablets, both of which are of *doubtful authenticity*. Feel free to read the article below, take a look at the images and draw your own conclusions.  


In *Russell Burrows* own words this is is account of how he discovered the cave having stopped to eat his lunch on a bluff that overlooks a valley. He stood up and stepped on the edge of a flat, round rock.

His weight on the side of this rock flipped it as if on a pivot and he fell into a pit below the rock....

&gt;""I found myself falling into a pit which had been secreted beneath a large oval stone which, as I later discovered, was fitted into the pit opening and designed to flip or turn over when stepped on. The unfortunate victim would fall to the bottom of the pit, the stone would swing back in place and the victim would be trapped. I was fortunate: When I stepped on that stone, I was in the act of turning, and the stone, instead of flipping over, slid off to one side and left the pit open.  
I do not actually remember hitting bottom; my next recollection is of hanging on to the lip of the pit by my elbows, in great alarm. I admit that I have a great fear of holes that I’m not ready for, because of snakes. But I found none. When I freed myself and regained my composure, I began to examine the pit and have a look at what was to be the beginning of the greatest adventure of my life... I sat down to calm my nerves, catch my breath and give the situation some thought.""

He found himself in a chamber, with a huge face on one wall, and continues....

&gt;""I did not have to be a genius to figure out that I had stumbled into something that just should not be in Illinois. I have hunted for and found many artifacts of the American Indians and there are many of their sites in my part of the state, but I knew then that this was not American Indian. The face I had been nose to nose with was different from anything I had ever seen. The nose was flat, the eyes were wide-set, and the lips were thick.  
Then, of course, there were all those strange symbols to consider. I had crawled under a ledge and was looking for *petroglyphs* such as I had seen in the pit. I had searched all the walls of the entire length of the valley, and while I had seen a few *scratchings*, I was not all that excited about what I had seen so far. Finally, I gave up on this last place, and decided to quit. In disgust, I tossed my small rock pick against the inside wall of the overhang.  
   
The rock gave out a distinctly unnatural sound: a hollow ring, not what I’d expect from solid rock... As it was now clear that a cave was on the other side... My first entrance was through this portal and into a tunnel-like passage which has a drop-off of about three feet just inside of the portal. I was met with a strong, musty odor. Not of decay, but musty.  
As I moved my head and light around, I saw a full human skeleton reposing on a large block of stone. It scared the hell out of me! Then I began to see other things lying there with those bones. I saw ax heads, spear points, and something else—metal! The skeleton was laid out upon a solid block large enough to hold not only the remains but artifacts as well.  
   
The *artifacts* include ax heads of marble and other stone material, an ax head of what appears to be bronze, a short sword of what appears to be bronze, and other artifacts which might be considered personal weapons. There were also a set of three bronze spears, the longest being about six feet long and the shortest about three feet...  
   
The skeletal remains bear several fine artifacts such as armbands, headbands and other such items, all of gold. ""

The cave is said to lie somewhere along the Skillet Fork of the Little Wabash River in southeastern Illinois.

It supposedly contains 13 elaborately ornamented burial crypts. It is unclear and a matter of controversy who, besides Burrows, has actually been inside the cave . What is known is that Burrows has produced hundreds, if not thousands, of curiously carved stones that he says came from this cave. And some of the artifacts allegedly were not of stone, but of gold.

It is claimed that Burrows sold off enough artifacts to unknown buyers that he was able to place $7 million in Swiss numbered bank accounts. According to Swiss journalist **Luc Buergin**, this money derives from the illegal sale of gold artifacts from the North American burial site.

Other sources claim that Burrows melted down all the gold and sold it as ingots. Still others question whether there ever was any gold in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Edge of the rock cliff, approx. 300 ft. from the entrance to the cave.](https://preview.redd.it/qgvlfiy57nd41.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b64ee2a503f14be2f866d5b6b73fcf632e59f035)

&amp;#x200B;

 

A bizarre collection of *artifacts* was found in a remote cave system in the American State of Illinois. The cavers who made the discovery encountered a derisive response from the first academic experts they approached, experiencing a lot of difficulty finding necessary specialists to help them document and identify the artifacts.

There were problems of site security, disappearing artifacts, as well as people bending data to suit their personal agendas. As the site researcher **Fred Rydholm** remarks: ""For this kind of research you have to be thick-skinned, brave or crazy!"" It’s one thing finding these things, its quite another to explain them.

In the United States the saga of ""Burrows Cave"" has been going on for many years. Over three thousand rock fragments, engraved with a variety of ancient drawings, hieroglyphs and script, were presented to the world by **Russell Burrows** in 1982, who discovered them in a cave system in Southern Illinois. The story of the cave and its contents is so strange, that it’s little wonder it has met strong skepticism.

Recently deciphered for the first time, the stone tablets tell such a wild tale that it will require quite a turn around to accepted history. I was stunned into disbelief when I first laid eyes on the Burrows Cave evidence.

This is no straight forward set of hieroglyphs but, an inexplicable display of several cultures, a huge library preserved on *stone tablets*, collected together and sealed in a cave *sometime around the first millennium*.

&amp;#x200B;

[Gold artifact from the cave, clearly showing Egyptian or Egyptian inspired marks on the gold.](https://preview.redd.it/dvkfnuba7nd41.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd5bde287b9fb60d6501337a7944d3b83aae9b5b)

 

The first photographs of the artifacts were forwarded to me by **Filip Coppens**, who writes about world mysteries in Belgium.

He had heard about my investigation of the anomalies surrounding the presumed hoax of Egyptian hieroglyphs in the NSW Hunter Valley. He was struck by certain odd similarities between the two finds and sent pictures of the carvings which depicted a wolf-headed god, similar to an ""Anubis"" carving photographed in the Hunter Valley.  


Certainly, the *Burrows Cave* boasts a few forms of wolf and jackal-headed deities, from *the classical Anubis to half human versions.* One of the Burrows Cave examples is executed in bas-relief, with accompanying hieroglyphs, embossed on a gold plate. However, there is much more than *wolf-headed deities*, the carved tablets display an extraordinary cultural array. There is a hodgepodge mixture of images and cultural influences which make the artifacts very hard to explain. Even worse, some of the carvings seem amateurish or dimly remembered copies of ancient Greek and Mesopotamian sources.  


Whereas, others involve a high level of skill and obvious knowledge of ancient cosmology. One of the images depicts a ""wolfish"" deity in priestly regalia, wearing a bishop-style hat decorated with a solar emblem. The deity has been identified as the god ""So-Bek-Ra"", who is so pictured on a temple by the Nile. The figure stands, as the lone representative of an ancient priesthood, against an advancing enemy army.

There are also many carved heads, mostly warrior profiles, wearing both Greek, Roman and Egyptian headgear.

&amp;#x200B;

 

Curiously, there are even images of ancient Amer-Indians wearing feathers and facial designs, some showing clear Meso-American style head-dress. Records of ancient travellers? Amongst them are many ancient mystical and sacred designs, as well as maps, pictures of ships and non-indigenous animals.

Astonishingly, one of the carvings portrays the cloven-hooved god **Pan**, holding his pipes and consorting with a nymph. Another stone (as well as an ancient metal coin) excavated from the cave carry the bold image of an elephant underlined with Hebrew characters.

Oddly, an artifact inscribed in exactly the same way was found on a pyramid-shaped stone in Ecuador some years earlier. Some of the carvings are meticulously executed in full bas-relief, some completely carved into the shapes of animals and deities, while other tablets were etched to render the designs.

Even a small collection of solid gold artifacts and coins have been excavated. More than just pictures, there are numerous tablets with coherent linear script carved on them. Examples and influences appear to range from Hebrew and Sumerian to Roman, Greek and Egyptian.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/8knl77jl7nd41.gif

&amp;#x200B;

 

In my correspondence with **Fred Rydholm**, the best theory I could offer, was to speculate about a colony of resourceful pirates, who in some distant time, raided and collected the strange quasi-cultural cache of artifacts for themselves.

Together with an associate Dr **James Scherz**, who helped in the study and documentation of the artifacts, Fred Rydholm found correlations between symbols on the Burrows Cave coins and coins produced by dynasties along the ""Silk Road"" between China and Rome, the most predominant being ""Kushana"" and ""Satavahana"" symbols.

(NOTE: The **Kushanas** once controlled a trade dynasty along the Silk Roads, uniting various ancient people’s in the days of the Romans. They disintegrated with the collapse of the Western part of the Roman Empire about AD 300. The **Satavahana**’s were a seafaring people who lived on the coast of the Indian Ocean and had large ships represented on their coins before they collapsed around 210-230 AD. This suggests the likely time period of early in the first millennium around or after 200 AD.)

Finally, Fred Rydholm was able to report a significant breakthrough with two young Florida researchers, **Paul Schaffranke** and **Brian Hubbard**, who were successful in deciphering some of the inscriptions. Schaffranke and Hubbard recognized them as being one of several ancient Etruscan alphabets which could be translated into ""street Latin"", as used around the time of *Christ*.  


The two Florida men were able to translate stone tablets from the Burrows Cave that the great epigrapher, Dr. **Barry Fell** and others, had insisted were gibberish and could not be translated. Mixed in amongst the *Etruscan script* there is also the added mystery of *Hebrew* and *Egyptian* stone tablets. These were also recently identified and are being translated by Dr. **Arnold Murray** of Arkansas and, **Zena Halpern**, a Hebrew scholar from New York. The Egyptian material is still being assessed. Over half a dozen professional archeologists and linguists have now examined the collection and have been definite in their support of the artifacts’ authenticity.  


At last contact, the Burrow’s team had dug out and classified an astonishing four thousand stone tablets. Another breakthrough came, when a retired engineer **Bill Kreisle**, found several of the stones recorded *accurate maps of the Mississippi River system as it appeared 2000 years ago*. Another map stone shows a river on the Iberian Peninsula (Spain) with the ancient city of Cadiz near its mouth. But, most astonishing of all, they have reported the discovery of several stone crypts, excavated from limestone deep in the cave system, containing a number of interred skeletons with jewellery, artifacts and statuary.  


The mystery people who left the cache of records are, apparently, themselves, buried there. The biggest continuing mystery of the discovery is, WHO carved all these message tablets and from whence came this hidden dynasty of bodies? **Fred Rydholm,** who works with and writes, for the retiring Col. Burrows, reports in his recent correspondence:

&gt;""Although I speak with caution, as it is still too early to say for sure, there are many indications that the bodies found in the crypts are the leaders of a colony of refugees from Ptolemaic Egypt, including a Jewish contingent from the Roman controlled Kingdom of Mauritania.""

**Dr Joseph Mahan**, founder and longtime president of the *Institute for the Study of American Cultures* (**ISAC**), has examined the evidence from the new translations and presents this interesting scenario:

&gt;""They were secretly sent to America in ships provided by the Mauritanian King Juba the Second and his wife Cleopatra Selene, daughter of Cleopatra and Marc Anthony. Included among the refugees were the Queen’s two brothers, who disappeared from Rome (and recorded history) in 17 AD, Ptolemy Philadelphus and Alexander Helios.""

The graves of these people have been the object of a comprehensive historical search for the past two thousand years. We appear to have an advanced and well funded group of priest/scholars who, with the ex-Royal families, escaped the Roman Christianization of Egypt and set off into the unknown somewhere around 200-300 AD. The engraved maps and their collected storehouse of knowledge, shows a deliberate transplanting of culture, perhaps to escape the religious persecution of the Roman Invasion of Egypt and establish a remote colony which could preserve the ancient records.  


Indeed, Dr **Joseph Mahan**, an archeological anthropologist who made a close study of the cave artifacts, reveals a detailed cosmology and religious lore from the cave material which is remarkably similar to that which survived amongst the Indian tribes of the area. The area of Southern Illinois and Indiana, where **Russell Burrows** stumbled into the limestone cave system, is richly endowed with the scattered evidence of several different early cultures which archeologists know too little about.  


There are log tombs, skeletons and artifacts from the Adena culture, which is believed to have developed around 500 BC and to have died out by 200 AD. There was the Hopewell culture, 100 BC to 350 AD.

A mysterious culture concentrated along the Mississippi, known as the ""Mississippian"", crystallized around 800 AD, and was thought to still be in existence when the Spaniards arrived. Researcher, Joseph Mahan, points out, that archeologists have collected evidence for fifty years of an elaborate and uniform *Earth/Sun religion*, associated with the building of flat top temple mounds, which spread out from the Mississippi in the later part of the first millennium.  


These *pyramid-like mounds*, which carried a permanent fire at the top, contained a variety of art, impressed on copper and stone, depicting animal-headed deities, crosses, swastikas, and people in ceremonial dress performing rituals.

Examples of these mound sites are spread from Oklahoma, to Illinois, Alabama and Georgia.

.passenger airliner. 

Were there:

The two pilots went down with the plane and were blown up by explosives that exist on spy jets to prevent information falling into wrong hands. The US media said it was a passenger plane with 80-100 passengers to discourage Iran, India, Pakistan etc. from sending their assets there. However, after Taliban posted video showing insignia indicating it was a Bombardier E-11A, the US media changed their story, admitting the spy jet part, but still lying about the captured CIA agents.

565,OperationMobocracy,evfqie,"It doesn't have to be US currency, but I guess my main interest is in unresolved cases of large volumes of counterfeit currency or long-duration resolved cases where the currency was being passed for years before it could be tracked down.

Are there any contemporary conspiracies about large amounts of existing currency being considered counterfeit?  It seems like anywhere I can get away with spending $100 bill, there's somebody with a pen or light of some kind checking it to see if its legitimate, and this is despite $100s having a fair amount of anti-counterfeiting technology built in.  So people seem actively paranoid about it, despite it being less likely than it was 20 or so years ago.

I'm vaguely familiar with the idea that North Korea was involved in a large-scale counterfeiting operation, although it was a denied accusation and it would make sense that DPRK would get blamed to deflect from some black op involving counterfeiting.

That being said, state sponsored counterfeiting of US currency makes a ton of sense.

567,onn747,evfmvs,"Justin Bieber was on Ellen yesterday to announce his new album release date, but was showing signs of something else going on.

At the beginning of the video, he keeps repeating the words ""thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you"" as Ellen is talking, and near the end of her sentence she sort of hand signals him to stop it, like she's telling him ""let me finish talking first"".

Then Justin changes how hes sitting multiple times. I don't know why he did this.

Then at 1:09, he laughs pretty obnoxiously at the comment Ellen made, almost like he's not entertained with her humor. They cut off his laugh pretty quickly with a loud laughing track over his mic audio. It even seems to be two laugh tracks, etched into one?

Then around 3:17 Justin kind of under reacts to her joke about her co-host being hot across the room. He says ""oh, wow"" and doesn't even bother to look across the room, like hes not very interested or entertained by her joke.

Now this is the part that really stood out for me, at 4:41 he starts tapping his feet, something he did not do for the entire interview, even thru all this fidgeting. This stood out for me because he seems to be foreshadowing his reaction to the gift that Ellen got him. Seconds later he plants his feet on the ground, getting out of the chair while acting super surprised. It's not a surprise to me that he knows what Ellen is giving him, but it's interesting to see him physically foreshadowing it. Almost like he's letting us in on the stage direction?

Last, when holding up the apron, he finishes Ellen's sentences and I don't know the exact way to describe this other than he seems so disengaged to this segment, especially at the end like ""whatever, I'll hold it up, oh we're gonna play a game? Cool..""

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I never thought that this talk show Ellen was real, but maybe it is so fake that Justin is beginning to get annoyed at that type of behavior in Hollywood, people acting like everything is fine and dandy when it is certainty not. Or maybe Justin has found out dirt about Ellen, or he is sick of being everyone's dancing monkey, because EVERY other time on Ellen he has been sitting sturdy, polite, NOT interrupting, and let's just say a ""perfect actor"". . Maybe thru this awakening that he's had he has come to a conclusion that people like Ellen are the worst part of Hollywood. I also believe all of these clues are extremely subtle because Hollywood producers know every trick a celebrity will pull. Like how Kanye acted before he went on his own Ellen rant.

I don't know guys, everyone in the YouTube comment section says he is having anxiety, I do not think that is the case. I think it is very hard to see what he is doing because if it was clearer, it wouldn't have been released... so Justin did subtle things to keep the show rolling, but sent a clear message to those who actually watch whats going on....

Do you see what I see?

Symbolism throughout Back to the Future seems to reference Biff Tannen as Donald Trump. The trilogy also seems to contain a plethora of symbolism/predictive programming/warnings throughout its run-time, including 9/11 and the JFK assassination, to name a couple.

:--:#Trump's connection to Nikola Tesla#:--:

On January 7, 1943 one of the world's most profound and influential inventors met an untimely end. Nikola Tesla died from a Coronary Thrombosis -- the formation of a blood clot within a blood-vessel of the heart. When he died, the only concern amidst the circle of his closest -- and much the same, those who also opposed him; securing his life's works; notes, blueprints, trial-studies etc. Well, as it would turn out, the one person to succeed in this task was none other than the uncle of our current president -- John Trump. So, little Donald Trump could have very likely grown up bouncing on his uncle's knee hearing stories of these wondrous and marvelous inventions.

:--:#Baron's Oddysey#:--:

In 1893 a lawyer by the name of Ingersoll Lockwood wrote a book entitled *Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey*. This novel details the adventures of a young but prominent aristocrat who lives in Germany by the name of Baron Trump. Say, don't we know a young but prominent aristocrat by the same name? He also lives in what's called ""Trump Castle"". Being stricken and wrought in ennui, is given a manuscript by a friend of his father's and written by a man called Don. Isn't that a coincidence. In this manuscript is a detailed account of a ""world within a world"". Which is only accessible via portal in another country. That country being none other than where? ...**RUSSIA!**    
Throughout the book little Baron Trump comes to discover 4 new worlds.    
1. *The Land of Transparent Folk*- The people here wear long black cloaks and hold large black fans to cover their transparent bodies. If they say something untrue the fan envelops them and the become opaque.    
2. *The Land of Sodopsies or Ant People*- Driven into darkness by an ice-age the people here were no longer exposed to natural light or sound and lost their hearing and eyesight. They developed a sign-language using touch.    
3. *The Frozen Land of King Gilead*- Everything here is mad of ice and everyone here has a very low body temperature. Their brains are ""Frozen"" thus causing cognitive response to slow. Actions such as processing information and making decisions takes longer. They dislike anyone with warm body temperatures, which they call ""hot-heads"".    
4. *The Land of the Rattlebrains or Happy Forgetters*- Everyone here only has a memory span of an hour or so. Heads are smaller because no memories are stored. They view this as a virtue since if no one remembers anything, then disagreements and grudges are virtually non-existent.    
I've made no effort to find connections with the worlds in the book and ours besides the lessons to be learned.    

:--:#Ivanka Trump's New Year in Paris#:--:

In the spirit of ""ringing in the new year"" Ivanka Trump posted a series of photos to Instagram of her celebration of new year's in Paris, France. Though these photos may seem like another meaningless ""celebrity flex"" to those who aren't ""in-the-know"", but to those of us who are, a number of these photos stand out and seemingly bare some aspects of significance.    

To detail a few of these photos -- all of which can be found on her Instagram -- I'll describe the photo and afterwards will explain its significance. They all seem to make reference and pay homage to the book *""Race Around the World""* and one or two seem to reference Project Looking Glass.    

1. Ivanka can be seen peering through one of the many telescopes mounted around the top of the Eiffel Tower. She's wearing a Black and white checkered/spotted coat and is wearing maroon-colored gloves. The reference to project looking glass is obvious, but the outfit she is wearing is the exact outfit the protagonist in *""Race Round the World""* can be seen wearing on the cover of the book.    

2. Ivanka is standing on the back-side of a massive clock. She is wearing a long-sleeved black dress. On the cover of *""Race Around the World""* the protagonist is in front of a clock also. On a page inside the book is an illustration of the protagonist stepping off a train wearing a Black long-sleeved dress. Another exact match in wardrobe.    

3. This time Ivanka is facing away from the camera atop the Eiffel Tower. She seems to be admiring the city below, or the horizon. Whatever the case the sky and clouds' colors were edited to match the sky's color on the front of *""Race Around the World""*. Once again she can be seen wearing her black and white checkered coat and maroon gloves.    

4. Both Ivanka and Jared are standing in front of a series of mirrors. Their reflections repeated a number of times. (Looking Glass? Or something I thought of; symbolizing the multiverse theory or multiple realities theory?) In any case the significance isn't in the photo itself but in regards to the caption which read ""Reflecting on the new year💛."" Who uses a yellow heart intentionally? No one I know. A number of people wondered this also and some digging was done. It was discovered that when referencing the color Yellow in the Color-codes for emergencies aboard Naval vessels it correlates with the letter ""Q"" and has the meaning statement ""My vessel is healthy and I request free pratique.""    

These subtle little drops/nudges are too frequent to be purely coincidental.    

**For example:** Melania wore a yellow dress with 2 or 3 flowers -- Hibiscus specifically, on it. Upon further research, it was found out that this specific color of hibiscus goes by the name of ""Perfect Storm."" Coincidence? I think not. Melania has also worn a number of other yellow outfits, such as a one-piece solid yellow suit/jumper with yellow heels.    

Though this ""proofs"" compilation began as a means to answer the question of ""Is Donald Trump a time traveler?"" i may lose a few of the one's reading this here, if i havent already because although unintentional, this is where it seems to begin to collide majorly with QAnon. But regardless of whether you subscribe to the theory or not, i find it just as compelling.    


:--:#QAnon Relations and Tie-ins#:--:    

The photos Ivanka posted to her Instagram were uploaded at 5:48 AM which seems to correspond with Q-drop 1317 which was posted on the fourth of May in 2018 (5 4 8) containing the words ""Racing Around the World"" in a stringer. The Q-drop in question was in regards to John Kerry secretly meeting with Iran to salvage a ""deal"". A stringer read *""Why is Hussein/JK traveling **WW** and meeting with foreign heads of state (some enemies of the US)?"" **WW** stands for **world-wide**. John Kerry met with Kamal Khazari of Iran -- in Paris of all places, while totally undermining the Logan Act which prohibits unauthorized negotiations with foreign nations, on May 13, 2018 -- eight days AFTER the afirementioned q-drop.    

:--:#Revisiting the Race#:--:    

Going back to the book *""Race Around the World""*, there's a page with an illustration depicting the protagonist in a room with a projector. Among some other pages strewn halphazardly across the floor is a drawing of a train that resembles a train drew by a man by the name of Charles Dellschau. Dellschau's artwork was discovered in a scrapbook of sorts containing many more illustrations, sadly only after hia death. This man drew many odd travel-vessel illustrations; all of which had the word ""Trump"" incorperated in some form or another. There was an illustration of an aircraft of sorts that was dubbed the ""Homer-Trump"". Strangely enough the train illustration ive been alluding to this entire time was literally called ""Trump Train"" and when you examine the drawing further you can see a little boy inside a window of the train who people have said mildly resembles Baron Trump, but when you take a look at the conductor it looks strikingly remniscent of none ither than The Donald. These are some scary coincidences to come out of some illustrations from the 1920's. I plan on further researching Charles Dellschau at another time.    

:--:#More correlation between Baron, Q and Ingersoll#:--:    

There was a Q-drop containing a stringer with the words ""An Ingersoll Jumbo Model Pocket Watch"". Well there's a watch company going by the same name as the author of the book I detailed earlier about a Baron Trump, called Ingersoll. Ingersoll's largest model pocket watch is called the ""Trump"". To make matters stranger the Ingersoll company was located at 45 John St. New York. 45?! Isn't Donald Trump the 45th US president, and oh, wait! Isnt John the name of Donald Trumps uncle who was gicen the task of securing Nikola Tesla's belongings?    

:--:#Conclusion#:--:    

At what point can the skeptics admit that coincidences of this magnitude and frequency can no longer be considered coincidences? Let's not forget the number of times that QAnon has warned/informed us of an event/happening days or even weeks before it actually occurs.

You can also see ""Kobe"" walking around between 2:34 to 2:45 and between 4:11-4:18.  It's perhaps worth noting that at 2:44 you can see him standing farther back and on lower ground than the people around him, while having his head still appear above the peoples' heads around him.

Before I get bashed - I'm not saying this is definitely him, but with some of the strange stuff surrounding the ""crash"", i.e. him being passed by Lebron on the all-time scoring list, the grammys and the old cartoon depicting his death by helicopter crash, it's worth looking into.  Some things, like the back of the dollar bill, are hidden in plain sight.

614,JStormCatcher,evd0ot,"A preface: I have been editing at Wikipedia for about 6 years now, and have not come across an article as biased as this.

There is an [article (take the time to skim through it quickly)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Posobiec) on Jack Posobiec, an alt-right Twitter user. Since it was created, it has been the subject of numerous disputes regarding the tone and neutrality of it. Each and every time a dispute has been raised, Wikipedia editors and administrators alike immediately congregate around the article and revert any attempt to make it sound neutral. 

For example, the [section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Posobiec#Political_activities) on Posobiec's political activities is quite literally a shit list which includes unsubstantiated claims. I attempted to convert the section from list format to prose format without making any changes to the claims, but was instantly reverted by [this user who accused me of whitewashing/censoring the article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jack_Posobiec&amp;diff=938057508&amp;oldid=938055805). Ironic, right? I didn't even make any changes to the claims.

I decided to bring the matter to the [talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jack_Posobiec#Bold_edit_rationale_and_further_discussion_to_fix_NPOV), where I could hopefully establish a consensus to make the proposed changes. One of the changes I proposed was removing [this](https://www.phillymag.com/news/2017/09/16/jack-posobiec-trump-fake-news/) article from the reference section, citing it as biased and heavily opinionated, and it was being used to present opinion as fact in the lead section of the article. When asked to explain my rationale behind removing the source, I provided two heavily biased paragraphs from the article in question. Take a look at [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/4n9GoTb.png).

See anything weird?

The two paragraphs I took from the article to demonstrate bias was instantly expunged by a Wikipedia administrator under the rationale of ""non-free content"". To this day the source remains on the page. You may take a look at the article and draw your own conclusions. 

Going back to the ""political activities"" section and the user who accused me of whitewashing the article. He [reported me to administrators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Edit_warring#User:CatcherStorm_reported_by_User:Praxidicae_(Result:_)) for edit warring, citing the ""consensus"" policy at Wikipedia. The consensus policy pretty much states that when it comes to editing at Wikipedia, the majority wins. And the majority of editors at Wikipedia are liberal. 

As a result of that report, I was blocked from editing Wikipedia by the same administrator who censored my comments on the talk page before. The goal was achieved- to prevent editors with valid and opposing viewpoints from challenging the bias on this article.

Here's the last thing I'll say about this. Take a look at [this exchange](https://i.imgur.com/XUirSUB.png) between an editor who supported the changes I proposed and a left-leaning editor. He refers to the biased sources I challenged as ""reliable"" and told the editor he was just ""making shit up"" regarding Pizzagate.

I have appealed my block and as of the time of this post I am waiting for a reply from an administrator. But it's abundantly clear here- Wikipedia has a systemic bias problem.",conspiracy,Systematic bias and censorship at Wikipedia  please take the time to read

&amp;#x200B;

 

As official videographer for the U.S. government, **Kurt Sonnenfeld** was detailed to *Ground Zero on September 11, 2001*, where he spent one month filming 29 tapes:

&gt;""What I saw at certain moments and in certain places ... is very disturbing!""

He never handed them over to the authorities and has been persecuted ever since.

Kurt Sonnenfeld lives in exile in Argentina, where he wrote ""[El Perseguido](http://elperseguido.wordpress.com/)"" (the persecuted). His recently-published book tells the story of his unending nightmare and drives another nail into the coffin of the government’s account of [the 9/11 events](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_911.htm).

Below is an exclusive interview by Voltairenet.

&amp;#x200B;

[Kurt Sonnenfeld and unidentified search and rescue specialist in subterranean void beneath Ground Zero.](https://preview.redd.it/ktl41hzl6ld41.jpg?width=399&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bdbcdeddde7207afd7ac58300370253f72e1507)

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Introduction**  


Kurt Sonnenfeld graduated from the University of Colorado (USA) with studies in *International Affairs and Economics*, as well as in *Literature and Philosophy*. He worked for the United States government as official videographer and served as *Director of Broadcast Operations for the Federal Emergency Management Agency* ([FEMA](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_FEMA.htm))’s *National Emergency Response Team.*

Additionally, Kurt Sonnenfeld was contracted by several other governmental agencies and programs for classified and “sensitive” operations at military and scientific installations throughout the United States.  


On September 11, 2001, the area known as “Ground Zero” was sealed from the public eye. Sonnenfeld, however, was given unrestricted access enabling him to document for the investigation (that never took place) and provide some “sanitized” pool video to virtually every news network in the world. The tapes that reveal some of the anomalies which he discovered at Ground Zero are still in his possession.  


Accused of a crime that did not occur in a manifest frame-up scenario, Kurt Sonnenfeld has been persecuted across continents.

After several years of fear, injustice and isolation, he has decided to take a public stand against the Government’s official story and is prepared to submit his material to the close scrutiny of reliable experts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Interview**

&gt;**Voltaire Network:** Your autobiographical book titled ""[El Perseguido](http://elperseguido.wordpress.com/)"" (the persecuted) was recently published in Argentina where you live in exile since 2003. Tell us who is persecuting you.  
**Kurt Sonnenfeld:** Although it is autobiographical, it is not my life story. Rather it is a history of the extraordinary events that have happened to me and my family at the hands of U.S. authorities over the course of more than seven years, spanning two hemispheres, after my tour of duty at Ground Zero and becoming an inconvenient witness.  
   
**VN:** You explained that your request for refugee status within the terms of the Geneva 1951 Convention is still being considered by the Argentinean Senate, while in 2005 you were granted political asylum, albeit, on a provisional basis.  
   
That probably makes you the first U.S. citizen in that situation! And no doubt the first U.S. Government official with direct exposure to the events surrounding September 11, 2001 who has “blown the whistle”.  
   
Is this what drove you into exile?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[With wife Paula, testifying before Senate](https://preview.redd.it/tdlnln1r6ld41.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2a60cf77629a89e59de0b08bb00c93af93d7e1b)

&amp;#x200B;

 

**KS:** A refugee is a person who has been forced to leave (or stay away from) his or her country for reasons of persecution. It’s undeniable that many people have been persecuted unfairly as a result of the quasi-fascist laws and policies brought about by the shock of September 11, 2001, and they deserve refugee status.

But the fact is, requesting refugee status is a risky and dangerous step to take. America is the world’s only remaining “superpower”, and dissent has been effectively repressed. Any person who requests refugee status on political grounds is by nature making an extreme statement of dissent. And if your request is denied, what do you do? Once you make the request, there can be no going back.  


Personally, I wasn’t forced to leave the United States, and I certainly did not “flee”. At the time I was still fairly oblivious to what was actually brewing against me. I hadn’t connected the dots yet; so that when I left in early 2003 I had every intention of returning.

I came to Argentina for a short respite; to try to recuperate after all that had happened to me.

I traveled here freely, with my own passport, using my own credit cards. But because of an incredible series of events, I have since been forced into exile, and I haven’t been back.  
 

**VN:** What type of events are you referring to?  


**KS:** I’ve suffered false accusations for “crimes” that demonstrably did not happen, abusive imprisonment and torture as a result of those accusations, as well as outrageous calumnies against my reputation, death threats, kidnap attempts and several other violations of civil and human rights as denounced by numerous international accords.

My return to the United States would not only be a continuation of those violations, but would be aggregated by the separation - perhaps permanent - from my wife and three-year old twin daughters, the only thing remaining that I have to live for.

And then, after the impossibility of receiving a fair trial for a crime that did not happen, I could be subject to the death penalty.  
 

**VN:** In 2005, the U.S. Government lodged a request to have you extradited, which was turned down by a Federal Judge. Then, in 2007, the Argentinean Supreme Court – in a show of integrity and independence - turned down the U.S. appeal, but your Government persisted. Can you shed some light on the situation ?  


**KS:** In 2008, the US government appealed again, this time with absolutely no legal foundation, to the Supreme Court, which will surely uphold the two already unassailable rulings made by the Federal Judge.  


In one of those rulings, it was also noted that there were too many “sombras”, or shadows, surrounding my case. There were many, many obvious fabrications in the extradition order sent here by US authorities, and, thankfully, we were able prove that.

The fact that there were so many fabrications has actually served to support my request for asylum. We were also able to show that we had been subject to a prolonged campaign of harassment and intimidation from US intelligence services. As a result, since my family has been assigned round-the-clock police protection.

As one senator has noted about my case:

&gt;“It is their behavior that belies their true motivations”.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Sonnenfeld and his family are frequently harassed, followed, and photographed, as shown in this photo.](https://preview.redd.it/gjpajmit6ld41.jpg?width=388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c15447311a67c61199b9fbfdb7859353c49fe2a)

&amp;#x200B;

 

**VN:** They want you pretty badly for a “crime that did not happen”! How do you account for such doggedness? As a FEMA official, you must have been trusted by your government. At what point did the situation capsize?  


**KS:** In hindsight, I realize now that the situation had capsized some time before I actually became aware that it had capsized. Initially, the false accusation against me was completely irrational, and I was totally destroyed by it. It is incredibly difficult to have suffered the loss of someone you love to suicide, but to then be accused of it is too much to bear.

The case was dismissed based on a mountain of evidence that overwhelmingly absolved me (Nancy, my wife, had left behind a suicide note and a journal of suicidal writings; she had a family history of suicide; etc.). The prosecution was 100% sure of my innocence before requesting the dismissal of charge.  


But the sustained incarceration even AFTER it was indicated that I was to be freed was what proved to me that something was happening under the surface. I was held in jail for FOUR MONTHS after my lawyers were informed that the case was to be dismissed and was finally released in June 2002.

During that time, an amazing series of strange events began to occur. While still being held, I had a telephone conversation with FEMA officials in an effort to resolve the issue, but I realized that I was considered “compromised”. I was told it had been agreed that “the agency had to be protected”, especially in light of the upheaval that was threatening with the implementation of the “Patriot Act” and the expected usurpation that would come with the new *Department of Homeland Security*.

After all the dangers I had risked, all hardship and difficulties I had endured for them for almost 10 years, I felt betrayed. It left a void in my soul.  


Because of their abandonment, I told them I didn’t have the tapes, that I gave them to “some bureaucrat” in New York, and that they would have to wait until I was released to retrieve any other documents in my possession. Soon after that conversation, my house was “seized”, the locks were changed, and men were observed by neighbors entering my house, though there is no record in the court of their entry, as would be required.

When I was finally released, I discovered that my office had been ransacked, my computer was missing, and that my tape library in my basement had been dug through and several were missing. Men were constantly parked on the street near my house, my security system was “hacked” more than once, outdoor security lights were unscrewed, etc., to the point that I went to stay with some friends at their condo in the mountains, which was then ALSO broken into.  


Anyone who looks for the truth recognizes that there has been an amazing series of irregularities in this case and that an appalling injustice is being carried out on me and my loved ones.

This intense campaign to return me to American soil is a false pretext for other darker motives.  
 

**VN:** You have suggested that you observed things at Ground Zero that did not tally with the official account. Did you do or say anything to arouse suspicion in this respect?  


**KS:** In that same telephone call I said that I would “go public”, not only with my suspicions about the events surrounding September 11, 2001, but about several contracts I had worked on in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**VN:** What are your suspicions based on?  


**KS:** There were many things, in hindsight, that were disturbing at Ground Zero. It was odd to me that I was dispatched to go to New York even before the second plane hit the South Tower, while the media was still reporting only that a “small plane” had collided with the North Tower - far too small of a catastrophe at that point to involve FEMA.

FEMA was mobilized within minutes, whereas it took ten days for it to deploy to New Orleans to respond to Hurricane Katrina, even with abundant advance warning!

It was odd to me that *all cameras were so fiercely prohibited* within the secured perimeter of Ground Zero, that the entire area was declared a crime scene and yet the “evidence” within that crime scene was so rapidly removed and destroyed.

And then it was very odd to me when I learned that FEMA and several other federal agencies had already moved into position at their command center at Pier 92 on September 10th, one day before the attacks!

&amp;#x200B;

[Rubber landing-gear tyres visible in evidence container marked “FBI Plane Parts Only.”](https://preview.redd.it/xlqk63az6ld41.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5591af2a7c98be5e58a3627f9593cb150eee76b9)

&amp;#x200B;

 

We are asked to believe that all four of the “indestructible” black boxes of the two jets that struck the twin towers were never found because they were *completely vaporized*, yet I have footage of the rubber wheels of the landing gear nearly undamaged, as well as the seats, parts of the fuselage and a jet turbine that were absolutely not vaporized.

This being said, I do find it rather odd that such objects could have survived fairly intact the type of destruction that turned most of the Twin Towers into thin dust.

And I definitely harbor some doubts about the authenticity of the “jet” turbine, *far too small to have come from one of the Boeings!*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

What happened with Building 7 is incredibly suspicious.

I have video that shows how curiously small the rubble pile was, and how the buildings to either side were untouched by Building Seven when it collapsed. It had not been hit by an airplane; it had suffered only minor injuries when the Twin Towers collapsed, and there were only small fires on a couple of floors. There’s no way that building could have imploded the way it did without controlled demolition.

Yet the [collapse of Building 7](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_911_40.htm) was hardly mentioned by the mainstream media and suspiciously ignored by the 911 Commission.  
 

**VN:** Reportedly, the underground levels of WTC-7 contained sensitive and undoubtedly compromising archival material. Did you come across any of it?  
**KS:** The Secret Service, the Department of Defense, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of Emergency Management’s “Crisis Center” occupied huge amounts of space there, spanning several floors of the building.

Other federal agencies had offices there as well.

After September 11, it was discovered that concealed within Building Seven was the *largest clandestine domestic station of the Central Intelligence Agency* outside of Washington DC, a base of operations from which to spy on diplomats of the United Nations and to conduct counterterrorism and counterintelligence missions.  


There was no underground parking level at Seven World Trade Center. And there was no underground vault. Instead, the federal agencies at Building Seven stored their vehicles, documents and evidence in the building of their associates across the street.

Beneath the plaza level of US Customs House (Building 6) was a large underground garage, separated off from the rest of the complex’s underground area and guarded under tight security. This was where the various government services parked their bomb-proofed cars and armored limousines, counterfeit taxi cabs and telephone company trucks used for undercover surveillance and covert operations, specialized vans and other vehicles.

Also within that secured parking area was access to the sub-level vault of Building 6.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Approaching the entrance to the sub-level areas of Building 6](https://preview.redd.it/3tlnex757ld41.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=662568036e1fbe5217b07a2696a1f2c9d5928fd8)

&amp;#x200B;

 

When the North Tower fell, the US Customs House (Building 6) was crushed and totally incinerated.

Much of the underground levels beneath it were also destroyed. But there were voids. And it was into one of those voids, recently uncovered, that I descended with a special Task Force to investigate. It was there we found the *security antechamber to the vault*, badly damaged. At the far end of the security office was the wide steel door to the vault, a combination code keypad in the cinderblock wall beside it.

But the wall was cracked and partially crumbled, and the door was sprung partially open. So we checked inside with our flashlights. Except for several rows of empty shelves, there was nothing in the vault but dust and debris. It had been emptied.

Why was it empty? And when could it have been emptied?  
 

**VN:** Is this what set alarm bells ringing for you?  


**KS:** Yes, but not immediately. With so much chaos, it was difficult to think. It was only after digesting everything that the “alarm bells” went off.  


Building Six was evacuated within twelve minutes after the first airplane struck the North Tower. The streets were immediately clogged with fire trucks, police cars and blocked traffic, and the vault was large enough, 15 meters by 15 meters by my estimate, to necessitate at least a big truck to carry out its contents.

And after the towers fell and destroyed most of the parking level, a mission to recover the contents of the vault would have been impossible. The vault *had to have been emptied* *before* *the attack.*  


I’ve described all of this extensively in my book, and it’s apparent that things of importance were taken out of harm’s way before the attacks. For example, the **CIA** didn’t seem too concerned about their losses. After the existence of their clandestine office in Building Seven was discovered, an agency spokesman told the newspapers that a special team had been dispatched to scour the rubble in search of secret documents and intelligence reports, though there were millions, if not billions of pages floating in the streets.

Nevertheless, the spokesman was confident.

&gt;“There shouldn’t be too much paper around,” he said.

And Customs at first claimed that everything was destroyed.

That the heat was so intense that everything in the evidence safe had been baked to ash. But some months later, they announced that they had broken up a huge Colombian narco-trafficking and money-laundering ring after miraculously recovering crucial evidence from the safe, including surveillance photos and heat-sensitive cassette tapes of monitored calls.

And when they moved in to their new building at 1 Penn Plaza in Manhattan, they proudly hung on the lobby wall their Commissioner’s Citation Plaque and their big round US Customs Service ensign, also miraculously recovered, in pristine condition, from their crushed and cremated former office building at the World Trade Center.  
 

**VN:** You weren’t alone on the Ground Zero assignment. Did the others notice the same anomalies? Do you know whether they have they also been harassed?  


**KS:** Actually there were a few people on two different excursions that I know about. Some of us even discussed it afterwards. They know who they are and I hope that they will come forward, but I’m sure they have strong apprehensions as to what will happen to them if they do.

I will leave it to them to decide, but there is strength in numbers.  
 

**VN:** With the publication of your book, you have become a ""whistleblower"" - yet another step on which there is no going back!

There must be many people with inside knowledge about what really happened or did not happen on that fateful day. Yet, hardly any have stepped up to the plate and certainly no one who was directly involved in an official capacity. This is what makes your case so compelling. Judging from your ordeal, it is not difficult to imagine what is holding such people back.  


**KS:** Actually, there are several other very smart and credible people blowing whistles, too. And they are being discredited and ignored. Some are being harassed and persecuted, as I am.  


People are gripped by fear. Everybody knows that if you question US authority you will have problems in some way or another. At minimum you will be discredited and dehumanized. Most likely you’ll find yourself indicted for something completely unrelated, like tax evasion — or something even worse, as in my case. Look at what happened to Secret Service whistle-blower Abraham Bolden, for example, or to chess master Bobby Fischer after he showed his disdain for the US. There are countless other examples.

In the past I asked friends and associates to speak out for me to counter all the lies being planted in the media, and all of them were terrified as to the ramifications to themselves and their families.  
 

**VN:** To what degree would your discoveries at Ground Zero expose the government’s involvement in those events? Are you familiar with the investigations that have been carried out by numerous scientists and qualified professionals which not only corroborate your own findings but, in some instances, far exceed them? Do you regard such people as ""conspiracy nuts""?  


**KS:** At the highest levels in Washington, DC, someone knew what was going to happen. They wanted a war so badly that they at least let it happen and most likely even helped it happen.  


Sometimes it seems to me that the “nuts” are those who hold to what they’ve been told with an almost religious fervor despite all of the evidence to the contrary — the ones who won’t even consider that there was a conspiracy. There are so many anomalies to the “official” investigation that you can’t blame it on oversight or incompetence.

I am familiar with the scientists and qualified professionals to whom you refer, and their findings are convincing, credible, and presented according to scientific protocol - in stark contrast to the findings of the “official” investigation. In addition, numerous intelligence agents and government officials have now come forward with their very informed opinions that the 9-11 Commission was a farce at best or a cover-up at worst.

My experience at Ground Zero is but one more piece of the puzzle.  
 

**VN:** Those events are nearly 8 years behind us. Do you consider that uncovering the truth about 9/11 continues to be an important objective? Why?  


**KS:** It is of absolute importance. And it will be equally as important in 10 years, or even 50 years if the truth still has not been exposed. It is an important objective because, at this point in history, many people are too credulous to whatever “authority” tells them and too willing to follow.

People in a state of shock seek guidance. People who are afraid are manipulable. And being able to manipulate the masses results in unimaginable benefits to a lot of very rich and very powerful people. War is incredibly expensive, but the money has to go somewhere. War is very profitable for the very few. And somehow [their sons always end up in Washington DC](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_bush.htm), making the decisions and writing the budgets, while the sons of the poor and the poorly-connected always end up on the enemy lines, taking their orders and fighting their battles.

The enormous [black-budget](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_blackbudget.htm) of the US Department of Defense represents an unlimited money machine for the military-industrial complex, figuring in the multi-trillions of dollars, and it will continue to be so until the masses wake up, recuperate their skepticism and demand accountability.

Wars (and false pretexts for war) will not cease until the people realize the true motive of war and stop believing “official” explanations.  
 

**VN:** What is referred to as the *9/11 Truth Movement*, has been asking for a new, independent investigation into those events. Do you think that the [Obama Administration](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_obama.htm) holds out some hope in this respect?  


**KS:** I really hope so, but I’m skeptical. Why would the leadership of any established government willingly undertake any action that would result in a serious compromise to their authority? They will prefer to maintain the status quo and *leave the things the way they are*. The conductor of the train has been changed, but has the train changed its course? I doubt it.

The push has to come from the public, not only domestically, but internationally, like your group is doing.  
 

**VN:** A number of human rights and activist groups are supporting your plight, not least Peace Nobel Prize winner Adolfo Pérez Esquivel. How have the Argentinean people in general responded to your situation?  


**KS:** With an incredible outpouring of support.

The military dictatorship is still fresh in the collective memory of most of the people here, along with the knowledge that the dictatorship (along with the other South American dictatorships at the time) was backed by the CIA, directed at the time by [George Bush Senior](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/bush/bushb.htm).

They remember well the torture centers, the secret prisons, the thousands of people “disappeared” for their opinions, the living in daily fear.

They know that the United States today will do the same thing if they consider it beneficial, that they will invade a country to achieve their political and economic interests and then manipulate the media with fabricated “causus belli” to justify their conquests.

Modern Genetic Research Confirming Cayce’s Story. This section adapted from Mound Builders: Edgar Cayce's Forgotten Record of Ancient America by **Gregory L. Little.**  


DNA analysis on Native Americans began in the 1980s, but with rapid technological improvements. research intensified in the early 1970s. Several teams of genetics researchers at prominent American universities have been conducting numerous studies. Although results from early studies showed the expected Siberian-Asia ancestry of the majority of modem Native American tribes, things took an unexpected turn in 1997.

At that point it was found that a small percentage of modem Native Americans have an unusual type of DNA then known to exist out’, in a few locations in Europe and the Middle East. Subsequent research indicated that the European DNA was no the result of genetic mixing after Columbus. In addition, the same DNA was later found in the hone of an ancient American burial confirming that people carrying this unique DNA had entered America in ancient times.

However, in July 200, this unique gene was also found in a small tribe living in the northern Gobi Desert area. The DNA research initially seemed to promise solid proof of not only where the ancient Americans came from, but also when they came. However as might be expected, ancient DNA research has become a highly contentious issue with several competing sides. Most of’ the DNA research on Native American Indians has been done utilizing mitochondria. Every cell in our body contains hundreds to thousands of these tiny, football-shaped organelles. The mitochondria process glucose (sugar) into a usable form of energy for all of our body’s functions.

The mitochondria are believed to be an evolutional form of bacteria that adapted into a symbiotic relationship with multi-celled life forms. Thus, the mitochondria have their own unique DNA, which is simpler and easier to analyze than the human DNA found in the nucleus. Mitochondrial DNA (usually abbreviated as mtDNA) is passed to offspring only’ through the egg. Thus, it is not a combination of male and female genes. It is a haploid gene — meaning that it has only’ one dose of chromosomes.

The haploid mitochondrial DNA shows only the female lineage of a person. Diploid genes are two sets of combined chromosomes, the female set coming from the egg, the male chromosomes from the sperm. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is categorized into several types and groups termed haplotypes and haplogroups. That is, there are variations in the genetic cycle of mitochondria that fit into clusters. These clusters can trace lineage far back into time. There are 39 different, distinct mtDNA groups into which all humans fit and there are variations on these types.

While mtDNA analysis is not only easier than other forms of genetic testing, it has a further advantage. All DNA mutates over time. But mtDNA has a fairly’ steady rate of mutation that permits a reasonably accurate estimate of exactly’ when a particular group of people migrated from their primary group.

Thus, two important factors can be determined through analysis of mtDNA.

&gt;First, a living person (or the mtDNA from the remains of a deceased person) can be tested to determine the specific racial group from which the individual came.  
Secondly, the approximate time when that individual’s ancestors migrated from their primary racial group can be determined.

One way to view mtDNA testing is that it may be able to provide a racial family tree extending back to the beginning of humanity. The current idea in mtDNA analysis is that ancestory on the female side can eventually, be traced back to a genetic ""Eve."" The 39 types of mtDNA were presumably derived from this Eve. Whether this idea will be completely confirmed by research remains to be seen.

However, mtDNA testing has confirmed several oral traditions passed down through many generations in several tribes. For example, the indigenous people of Hawaii and Polynesia have long asserted that their ancestors frequently traveled back and forth and that they 'shared ancestor’.

Genetic testing showed that these two groups were related and confirmed the migratory’ legends of these peoples.

**Confirming the Siberian Migration**

The first research on living Native American tribes showed they were comprised of four distinct mtDNA haplogroups called A, B, C, and D. This means that the Native Americans are derived from four different lineages.

These haplogroups were also found in native populations in Central and South America. Utter mtDNA research utilizing ancient remains recovered in the Americas validated these four haplogroups. Three of these haplogroups, A, C, and D are found primarily in Siberian Asia.

The B haplogroup, however, is found only in aboriginal groups in Southeast Asia. China, Japan, Melanesia, and Polynesia.  
 

**Confirming a South Pacific and Japanese Migration**

Based on the mutations found in the mtDNA, most researchers think that groups A, C and D, entered America from Siberia across Beringia some time around 35.000 B.C. Group B, they assert, probably came to America from the South Pacific or Japan via boats. It is believed the B groups began this migration not long after the A, C, and D groups arrived. However, the majority of the B group arrived about 11.000 B.C. This leaves open the possibility of several migrations by the B group from different locations.

It should be noted that a few geneticists have proposed that each of these tour haplogroups came in four separate migrations. And many Clovis supporters argue that all the groups migrated together.  
 

**An Unknown and Unexpected Migration Group Confirmed**

In 1997, a fifth mtDNA haplogroup was identified in Native Americans. This group, called ‘""X,"" is present in three percent of living Native Americans. Haplogroup X was not then found in Asia, but was found only in Europe and the Middle East where two to four percent of the population carry it. In those areas, the X haplogroup has primarily been found in parts of Spain, Bulgaria, Finland, Italy, and Israel. In July 2001, a research letter was published in the American Journal of Human Genetics, relating that a few people with the ‘X' type had been identified in a tribe located in extreme southern Siberia.

These people, called the Altasians, or Altaics, as Russian geneticists refer to them, have always lived in the Gobi Desert area. Archaeologists and geneticists are certain that the presence of ""X"" in America is not the result of historic intermarriages. It is of ancient origin. In addition, the 'X’ type has now been found in the ancient remains of the **Basque**. Among Native American tribes, the X haplogroup has been found in small numbers in the Yakima, Sioux, and Navaho tribes. It has been found to a larger degree in the Ojibway, Oneota, and Nuu-Chah-Nulth tribes.

The X haplogroup has also been discovered in ancient remains in Illinois near Ohio and a 'few’ other areas near the Great Lakes. It has not (so far) been found in South or Central American tribes including the Maya. The X haplogroup appears to have entered America in limited numbers perhaps as long ago as 34.000 B.C. Around 12,000 B.C. to 10.000 B.C. it appeared in much greater numbers.

It is important to note that not all Native American tribes have been categorized by mtDNA analysis and that relatively few ancient remains have been tested.  
 

**The Significance of mtDNA Research**

The mtDNA research confirms most of’ the other new findings in archaeology. The Americas were settled early and many different racial groups came. Several different waves of migration probably occurred. The initial wave seems to have occurred around 35.000 B.C. However, it may have been far earlier since some of the recent radiocarbon dates that have emerged from areas like California and the southwest point to 50,000 B.C. But it must be kept in mind that mtDNA analysis is still in its infancy. Not all current Native American tribes and very few remains have been tested.

But the picture the mtDNA research findings paint of ancient America is astonishing. It may’ seem that the apparent widespread presence of the X type (from Canada and Washington State, to Arizona, to the Plains, to the Great Lakes area) could indicate a wide initial dispersal. However, the history of several of these tribes tells a different 'story’. The X type in ancient America appears to be linked to the Iroquois.

This tribe, of course, was, according to **Cayce**, partly the remnant of Atlantean survivors from its final destruction in 10.000 B.C. The finding of the X group in the north Gobi-dwelling Altasians is hailed as proof that all American migrations came from Siberia via the Bering Straits, yet it seems unlikely.

With the X type being present in the Middle East, Europe, [the ancient **Basques**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_genetica12.htm), and America, *a migration from the Gobi to all of these areas is doubtful*.

The Cayce readings cite a series of large and small migrations of Atlanteans to very specific parts of the world. These migrations occurred at several times, but especially during the years approaching 10.000 B.C. One of these places was to the Gobi in extreme southern Siberian Asia.

If we assume that haplotype X originated from Cayce’s Atlantis, some of the X haplotype should be found in the Gobi region— but very little of this group should be found elsewhere in Siberia. This is what has been found.  
 

**B Haplogroup may Originate from Mu**

The B haplogroup, found only in aboriginal groups in Southeast Asia, China, Japan, Melanesia, and Polynesia, may represent Cayce’s [people of Mu](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_lemuria.htm). Both Chinese and Japanese archaeologists take the idea of Mu seriously, and the B haplogroup findings closely match the story Cayce told about the continent. Most of the people of Mu who escaped the destruction in 50,000 B.C. escaped to China, India, and Japan. Some time later, descendants of these peoples could have traveled to America.

While [**Cayce**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_cayce.htm) said that some people from Mu entered the Americas about 50,000 B.C., he did not indicate that date as the time period when the majority of them came. We only know that it was after 50,000 B.C. and prior to 28,000 B.C.  
 

**A,C,&amp;D Haplogroups – from Siberia?**

The Cayce readings do indicate that people entered the Americas from both the east and west in 28.000 B.C. These migrants came from [Atlantis.](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_atlantida.htm) China, and from ""across the Pacific."" The 28.000 B.C. date matches well with the haplogroups A, B, C, and D proposed dates of entry into America. The Cayce readings do have references to the Bering Straits, but Cayce did not relate that there were migrations across it.

In fact, no one ever thought to ask him about this, so it remains an open question in the Cayce story. But the A, C, and D haplogroups clearly originated in Siberia just as the archaeologists have speculated. Cayce stated that the ""yellow"" or Mongol race of humanity originated in the 'Gobi and gradually’ spread throughout Asia.

Thus, according to Cayce, haplogroups A, C, and D probably originated in the Gobi and would be the migrations Cayce cited as coming from ""across the Pacific.""  
 

**The Atlantean Haplogroup may be X**

**Cayce** indicated that the largest migration from [Atlantis](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_atlantida.htm) occurred just before 10.000 B.C. The majority of these Atlantean survivors went to the Northeastern coastal areas of America and Canada becoming the Iroquois. It should be recalled that Cayce also stated that not all of the Iroquois were Atlantean. The Atlanteans migrating to the Americas merged with the people already present in America by that time.

The Atlanteans became kaders of the tribes. Cayce’s story’ makes it clear that the Atlanteans had serious disputes among themselves that were reflected in ongoing violent conflict. (This was the struggle between the Belial and Law of One groups.)

This is confirmed by the Iroquois’ ancient history that tells of constant battles resulting in distant displacements of entire tribes to ensure their survival. Perhaps the most astonishing confirmation of Cayce’s story of ancient America is the presence of haplogroup X. What is known is that the X haplogroup first showed up in America perhaps 34,000 years ago, but its main entry occurred in 10,000 B.C.

These dates match Cayce’s timeframe for Atlantean migrations as well as the occurrence of X in the specific tribes predicted by his statements. The X group also appears to have shown up in ancient Iberia and in the **Basques** about the same time as well as in the Gobi.

These dates match Cayce’s story of the final two destructions of Atlantis and the resulting migrations to these areas.",conspiracy,DNA Analysis on Native Americans

In the beginning… there were many [myths of creation](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_mitoscreacion.htm).

Many of the great spiritual traditions told of how the material world came into being out of a nameless domain.

Some traditions have spoken of the 'cosmic egg' from which form emerged; or, as in the Old Testament, out of the dark and formless deep where the spirit of *God* moved:

&gt;In the beginning *God* created the heaven and the earth; and the earth was without form, and void; and darkness \[was\] upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of *God* moved upon the face of the waters.  
**(Genesis 1:1-1:2)**

The Hindu spiritual traditions of India speak of an underlying reality that is Brahman - a reality that is eternal and eternally unchanging.

The world of space and time that we are familiar with is known as *lila*, which describes our physical world as the playground of unceasing creative play within Brahman.

In terms of this cosmology humanity is indeed at play in the fields of the *Lord*. The ancient Hindu Vedic rishis told that the essence of all things in the material world belonged to *Akasha*.

A Sanskrit term, Akasha refers to the fifth element of the cosmos, beyond,

&gt;air (vata)  
fire (agni)  
water (jal)  
earth (prithivi)

The concept of Akasha is similar to the later western notions of **ether** \- a space field that contains all the elements within itself.

In the late 6th century BC **Pythagoras** spoke of the 'ether' as the fifth element of the world, in addition to earth, air, fire and water.

In more modern terminology we see similarities with the notion of the underlying quantum vacuum (or plenum, matrix) that is described as the energetic sea of the cosmos from which matter-reality manifests. The Akasha/ether/quantum matrix is the cosmic energy domain from which everything has emerged, and into which everything will ultimately return.  


Western streams of philosophic thought also speak of a domain beyond space and time.

According to **Plato** there was a realm of Forms and Ideas - a domain of Pure Forms - beyond our space and time, and that our material world is only an image or copy of this real, pure world beyond.

This pure realm was also spoken of by other Hellenic philosophers:

&gt;Pythagoras referred to it as Kosmos, and Plotinus as The One.

Perhaps the most famous illustration of Plato's thinking is his [allegory of The Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave).

In this allegory Plato describes a group of people who have lived all their lives chained up and facing the wall of a cave.

All they can see is the blank cave wall that lies in front of them. The opening of the cave is behind them, and the light that enters casts shadows on the far wall of the cave. Upon this wall, day after day, the chained people watch shadows move across as they cannot turn around and see the 'real' objects that pass behind them. Thus, they view these shadows as their reality and ascribe forms, reason, and life to them.

This is the illusion - the shadows from beyond - that we ascribe as [our 'reality](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_consciousscience.htm#Reality)' and give meaning to.  


Similarly, the Chinese sage **Lao-Tze** (or Laozi) spoke of all things originating in the Tao/Dao as the unseen root of all material things. The Tao is both the originator (the source) of all things, and the destination to which all things eventually return. It is the unobservable and nameless no-space, no-time, no-form essence that our words fail.

Are these non-spaces the realms where our gods dwell?  


Our myths may be the only threads that connect us with such realms; they are the narratives that remain in the earthly domain to help jolt our memories.

In his theory of [anamnesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamnesis_(philosophy)) Plato says humanity possesses knowledge of its past, only that we have forgotten this knowledge and so we need to rediscover the knowledge within us.

Plato wrote that humanity could only know the 'real world' in the form of memories. That is, human thought was really a form of recollection, and that humankind generally existed within a state of collective amnesia, having only fragments of recollection as reference points for reality.

Plato was suggesting that humanity had lost - or fallen - from an earlier state of heightened awareness and now had only traces of this memory in their collective psyche as a reminder. In ancient Greek, truth is called *aletheia* which means not forgetting; and in Greek mythology before the human soul incarnates into this world it drinks from Lethe, the river of Forgetfulness and one of the five rivers of the underworld, so that it cannot remember its divine origins.

Similarly, there is a Jewish legend that speaks of how we are struck on the mouth by an angel before birth so that we cannot speak of our pre-birth divine origins.  


Humanity is being told through these and other related myths that we need to learn how to remember - that truth is re-collection, not cognition.

We arrive in this earthly reality full of cosmic glory, only that we lack the key, the crucial guide, to unlock our memories and unleash the flood of knowing.

When we come across the scattered symbols and signs of truth, we inherently intuit and sense deep down some great significance.

Yet our minds are incapable of grasping the intangibleness of this hidden mystery. And that is how our lives play out, as we slip as souls within a playground of signs that are invested with ultimate meaning.

We need to find the [Arianne's thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne's_thread_(logic)) to help us through this labyrinth that we find ourselves in, and to remember that we have our origins in the Primary Imagination.

Our lives are not only unique creations but are acts of re-creation. They are attempts at entering once again into a lost remembrance which lies so far and yet so close to us.

The 13th century Persian poet **Jalāl ad-Dīn Rūmī** wrote that,

&gt;'The Truth is closer to us than our own jugular vein.'

And yet so vain do we search, as if we have fallen away from **true** **remembrance**.  
 

&amp;#x200B;

**Myths Lost and Regained**  
One of humanity's most enduring mythic narratives is what is commonly referred to as *the Fall*.

What this generally suggests is a break with - or fall away from - another state. This is often interpreted as a break away from a heightened state of connection and awareness; or, a disconnection from the living truth.

This implies that collective images and myths reappear in our minds, in our histories, as grand archetypes that serve as signifiers to assist humanity in its recollection of lost memories.

Touching upon this, **Carl Gustav Jung** wrote that,

&gt;Our psyche is set up in accord with the structure of the universe, and what happens in the macrocosm likewise happens in the infinitesimal and most subjective reaches of the psyche. 1

Here, Jung is highlighting the distinct correspondence between the human psyche and [it's synchronization](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_synchronicity.htm) with the grander universe of which we are a part.

This emphasizes the notion of the participatory mind, a concept that was known - if not articulated - amongst our pre-modern ancestors.  


It has been suggested by various psychologists that humanity resonates closely with the notion of the 'Fall from Paradise' because we carry within our collective consciousness vestiges of a remembrance. That is, we have a deep intuitive sense that we once belonged to something 'higher,' and to which we may one day return.

It seems that within our interior selves lies the hope of returning to something once 'lost' - a Paradise Lost, or some sacred state of communion.

This idea has been expressed in allegorical form in many tales, such as in this one, 'The Precious Jewel,' adapted from Eastern sources:

In a remote realm of perfection, there was a just monarch who had a wife and a wonderful son and daughter. They all lived together in happiness.

One day the father called his children before him and said:

&gt;'The time has come, as it does for all. You are to go down, an infinite distance, to another land. You shall seek and find and bring back a precious Jewel.'  
The travelers were conducted in disguise to a strange land, whose inhabitants almost all lived a dark existence.  
   
Such was the effect of this place that the two lost touch with each other, wandering as if asleep. From time to time they saw phantoms, similitudes of their country and of the Jewel, but such was their condition that these things only increased the depth of their reveries, which they now began to take as reality.  
   
When news of his children's plight reached the king, he sent word by a trusted servant, a wise man:  
'Remember your mission, awaken from your dream, and remain together.'  
With this message they roused themselves, and with the help of their rescuing guide they dared the monstrous perils which surrounded the Jewel, and by its magic aid returned to their realm of light, there to remain in increased happiness for evermore. 2

This allegory/parable, amongst others similar, reveals that a latent message lays hidden deep within us, and which acts as a chord of remembrance keeping us connected with something 'essential' yet forgotten.  


Mythologists **Joseph Campbell** and **Mircea Eliade** have both shown that one story in particular threads its way through nearly all traditions and myths - the story of a lost idyllic golden age.

This mythical narrative tells of the hero's journey to restore the world to its former glory and high state:

&gt;a tale of loss and the need for heroic restoration.

It is also a journey to reconnect ourselves with a sense of the sacred; to restore the bond with a cosmos that enfolds humanity within a universal sense of meaning, where the human psyche merges into the significant whole.  


Many myths recovered from the past, and from indigenous tribes, reveal a worldview of our ancients that accepted all things as part of a living, conscious, and sacred cosmos.

Within this cosmological view all life was viewed as connected with an animating energy that interweaved throughout.

As mythological researcher **Richard Heinberg** writes:

&gt;I feel compelled toward the view that our cultural memories of a Golden Age of harmony are the residue of a once-universal understanding of the spiritual dimension of human consciousness, and are at the same time memories of how contact with that dimension has been almost completely severed. 3

The contact may appear almost severed, yet traces of it have remained in various traditions, some more obscure than others.

This once bygone state that the stories and myths refer to as the Golden Age - or Paradise - can also be regarded as a metaphor for an evolved state of consciousness as well as a highly evolved state of civilization.

Humankind's state is that of having fallen into the grip of gross matter, and of having left behind a finer awareness of subtle energies. We have, as all major spiritual traditions commonly state, entered into a realm of separation from a divine or sacred source.  


Mircea Eliade, in his [The Sacred and the Profane](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/sacred-profane.pdf), writes that every historical culture regarded the human condition as being under a temporary spell of unnatural limitation and separateness.

Also, that our world now contains symbols and signs that serve to jolt human consciousness into some degree of reawakened awareness and remembrance, such as in the tale of the 'Precious Jewel' told above.

Eliade reminds us that in so-called 'primitive' societies the act of understanding the symbol can help to succeed in 'living the universal.'

Similarly, mythologist Joseph Campbell describes how the aim of ancient spiritual practices, tribal myths, and [shamanic teachings](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_chaman.htm) was to assist in recovering a lost mode of awareness.  


It is easy to conclude that the myth of *Paradise* (or of a *Golden Age*) represents an innate and universal longing, deep within humanity, for a return to a state of tranquility from which we have become separated.

Metaphorically, it may indicate that the inner being of the human, when in its natural and essential state, is in balance and harmony.

Perhaps there have been historical ages in which human beings shared a state of oneness or union with all life and with their environment, and that this peak of civilization was indeed lost.

The [Hopi legend](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_leyenda_hopi.htm) of the 'First People' talks of a time in the ancient past when people,

&gt;'felt as one and understood one another without talking,' as if suggesting a form of collective communion.

This legend describes a time when humans on the planet manifested a form of suprasensory perception, and where dialogue often occurred between various entities.

Anthropologist **Roger Wescott** writes that:

&gt;Moreover, most mythic traditions concur in asserting that, in the Golden Age, human beings associated easily and often with beings that were discarnate or only intermittently incarnate, ranging from awesome cosmic deities to playful local spirits. 4

Eliade, likewise, noted in his research that ancient myths spoke of a *friendship between animals and human*, with even knowledge of their respective languages.  


Eliade speculates that the shamanic imagery and/or visions of human transformation into an animal may be a metaphorical account of re-establishing a connection that was lost 'at the dawn of time.'

According to Eliade, the shaman goes into a transcendental state in order to 'abolish the present human condition,' which is regarded as a resultant state from the 'Fall' - and thus to re-enter into the natural condition of 'primordial man' as it was during the *Golden Age*. 5

Heinberg considers whether:

&gt;…paradise may be seen as serving a specific function, as a design for living embedded in the circuitry of human consciousness. All biological organisms, including human beings, contain elements of design…  
   
Perhaps we also contain within us a neurological or psychic program for the optimal design of social and spiritual relations between ourselves, the Cosmos, and Nature - a design of telepathic oneness and interspecies communion that represents the goal toward which our individual and collective experience would naturally tend to unfold. 6

Heinberg is suggesting here that memories of Paradise/Golden Age may not only, or necessarily, refer to a physical reality or time but serve to activate and catalyze human neurological and psychic functioning into continued evolutionary growth.

The memory, then, is not only as a remembrance of things past (as Proust would say) but may also function as a 'design' wired into us as a social and spiritual guide during dark ages - those times when our psychic, and thus also physical, states are low and separated from a sacred source.  


Similarly, various religious, spiritual, and indigenous traditions all refer to this rupture (our 'Fall') as a descent into greed, egoism, fear, and selfishness.

It is a state where the focus is almost entirely upon gross materialism.

Gnostic, Hindu, and Buddhist traditions also refer to humanity forgetting its true purpose; of how the distraction of, and attraction to, the physical world produces a continued state of separation.

Teutonic Norse myths state that a renewal of the world would only come after great destruction in which a period of chaos and disorder would arise that would see humans commit many degrading and tragic acts.

There are also numerous accounts in ancient and sacred texts that depict the theme of cyclic destruction and renewal, from biblical accounts, Hindu scriptures, and Tibetan narratives.

Our myths, stories, and narratives may serve to remind us of where we have been, and to where we need to return.

Yet can we rely solely on the old myths, or,

&gt;Are we now in need of new mythologies?  
   
After all, where did all the gods go?

&amp;#x200B;

**New Mythologies**  


It has been said that our old gods are dead or dying.

The many gods of times past were abandoned in favor of *the one god concept* with the rise of [monotheistic religions](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/mistic/religionsplanetearth.htm). With this shift away from multiple gods - which played a more direct, intervening role in human affairs - a more individualized sense of self and self-consciousness began to emerge.

The spiritual focus was now not on the interaction with multiple gods but of a relation with a single source that was transcendent and beyond the lowly human. Humanity no longer played ball together with their *godly caretakers*.

The human psyche slowly became separated from a close communion with the gods. This psychic bond, or participation, between cosmic forces and the human soul gradually became severed, leaving the individual more to their own devices and further away from a 'far off' god.  


This break from the interventionist gods is likely to have played a role in the shift of human consciousness more towards its own self-involvement, which amplified the presence and dominance of the ego.

Along with this shift came the art of personal reflection, and the manifestation of individual thinking.

This can be seen in the external transition from ancient Egyptian spiritual traditions to the human philosophy of the Greeks. This marked a shift toward knowledge as grasped by the human mind, and thus led to the increased belief that no gods were needed to understand such lofty concepts.

Divinity, the realm of the gods, became a place to which certain elite human minds could broker access. This was seen as liberating the human soul from the direct and all-powerful influence of the gods in daily life.

A new independence arose within the life of humanity that preceded an era of increasing human autonomy at play within a material world. The human being was now born into an environment where the gods had withdrawn.

Humanity was now left to stand on its own spiritual feet, and to learn to navigate through a world given over to them by their gods. And yet it was precisely this kind of environment which made it possible for an individual human being to develop a sense of full responsibility for their own behavior and spiritual state.

The soul life of the human had now become their own task to contend with, and could no longer be seen as under the sway of external transcendental forces.

Although this shift placed the onus of development upon the human self, it also dissolved the reciprocal understanding between human and cosmos.  


By defining ourselves *independent of the gods* we also defined ourselves as similarly being separated from Nature.

This process of separation between our interior and exterior lives was drawn out over centuries, and further exacerbated through orthodox religious thinking, scientific rationalism, Cartesian philosophy, and attitudes to the human body.

We are now coming to the end of the influence of the [Greco-Roman/Judeo-Christian era](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_biblianazar.htm).

As philosopher **Jeremy Naydler** notes:

&gt;It has achieved its purpose, which was to make us more individuated, more self- rather than god-centered in our soul-life, and thus more free.  
   
But now there is a need to become aware again of inner, spiritual realities, but to become aware of them grounded in our own sense of self and with a clear and discriminating intelligence with which we can once more turn toward them. 7

Individual selfhood came at a great cost.

In fact, it could only come about when the previous gods had faded from human consciousness. And yet from this came the emergence of [self-consciousness](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_consciousuniverse.htm), the focus on individual selfhood, and the possibility for self-transcendence through individual inner work. That is, to take the path back toward a cosmic, sacred communion through self-volition and individual choice.

This path *back to the gods* (the sacred source) does not imply 'going out' there - to reach them in some realm beyond - but rather suggests allowing them back into the human psyche.

This means receiving the sacred connection once again within the inner life/self of the human. We could phrase it as bringing the sacred impulse back down into material life - the re-sacralization of the material plane.

It could be said that human destiny is to *know the infinite without leaving the finite* \- both exist simultaneously and both are necessary.  


Spirit is not recognized by it being something other than the material, but by overcoming its otherness. It is implicit within all material forms, and is in communion with all entities. In the sacred traditions spirit is a living recognition, not an inanimate one. That is, sacred spirit wishes to be known beyond its otherness.

Our multiple gods, as depth psychology informs us, also represent aspects of the human psyche.

Astrology places a similar pattern upon the planets, as their alignment influences psychic correspondences and can affect the human physically, mentally, and emotionally. In some of the most ancient spiritual traditions that came out of [Egypt](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_egipto.htm) and [Mesopotamia](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sumer_annunaki.htm) thousands of years ago, the realm of Spirit existed in a transcendental pure form beyond matter.

It was human destiny for the privileged capable few to ascend through rigorous trial and initiation toward this otherworld and seek a connection with it so that it may manifest through them upon the material plane.

Hence such cultures were star-orientated as this represented a source beyond the terrestrial earth. In more modern times, the implication has shifted to a view that sees Spirit as having its destiny to become implicated in matter.

Together, spirit and matter form the necessary communion.

The re-spiritualization - the re-sacralization - of the material world must come about through humanity's involvement. The human must embrace the cosmos within themselves, and to bring it 'down to earth,' so to speak.

This is now a mass endeavor, which suggests that the time for the elite special few initiates is over. In other words, where once a 'higher' state of consciousness was first developed through exceptional individuals, it is now to be developed through the mass by receptive individuals and communities connecting together across physical and temporal boundaries.  


A re-sacralization is required on a global scale - a sacred revival for our times - this very thing may be brought into play within our global civilization if we transition to a genuine relationship with our developing technologies.

Likewise, the natural world is not an obstacle that needs to be overcome if we are to strive towards a sacred communion and understanding.

On the contrary, the natural world is itself the playground upon which sacred energies move through, and within which lies the soul of the world. The old mythologies placed the gods within the supernatural world, where Nature was something to move through and beyond. Yet the old mythologies are no longer with us for they no longer serve the same purpose.

They too have been transcended for we are in a different era - an altogether different temporal and spatial state.

The old mythological world of archetypal energies has now been fused into an order where the supernatural, the natural, and the human mind-soul merge together.

We are participating in bringing the sacred back into the material realm - in bringing the gods back home!

The sacred source is to be encountered through ourselves and not within another world; through normal human consciousness rather than its denial.

We can say that,

&gt;'humanity has entered a new stage in the unfolding cosmological drama, and that this stage is to do with the infinite rediscovering itself within the sphere of the finite.' 8

From these ashes a new mythology must arise, one that has been gestating within the inner reaches of humankind for some time already.

It has been suggested that we are in a battle for the Western soul, as we have been largely sleeping through crisis after crisis of the spirit. A new mythology is rapidly becoming both a social and spiritual necessity, as our old frameworks and worldviews dissolve from usefulness.

Mythologies have the power to conduct and guide us through our lifetimes, as a companion upon the psycho-spiritual journey of transformation.

A mythology is a set of figures and symbols that can reflect and shape a state of mind; they can serve as a perceptual framework. They can be our filters and our friends, but they neither belong to us nor any particular locale.

They are available for everyone, and are beyond the individual mind.

According to **Joseph Campbell**, arguably one of the most respected mythologists of the 20th century,

&gt;The life of a mythology derives from the vitality of its symbols as metaphors delivering, not simply the idea, but a sense of actual participation in such a realization of transcendence, infinity, and abundance…  
   
The first and most essential service of a mythology is this one, of opening the mind and heart to the utter wonder of all being, and the second service, then, is cosmological:  
of representing the universe and whole spectacle of nature, both as known to the mind and as beheld by the eye…9

Mythology then should serve to assist participation in our own transcendence amid the spectacle of the cosmos.

Unfortunately, it is when mythologies become locked-in as social, political, and [religious control systems](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/mistic/religionsplanetearth.htm) that the human developmental path becomes distorted and muddy underfoot.  


Myths emphasize commonality and offer us a transcendental communion, if we don't corrupt them into further mental prisons.

It is essential therefore that the new mythologies for a sacred revival inspire within humanity a wish for interiorizing the cosmological impulse that is pervasive and which irradiates our reality.

It's all a lie.

History is being rewritten daily thanks to alternative media news sources bringing to light the mass propaganda of false history and disclosing truths hidden for decades and centuries.

My son's 3rd grade class was discussing [**Columbus**](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_colon.htm) in class this week. I pick him up each day to ""deprogram"" him from the public indoctrination system. When I asked him what he had learned about Mr. Columbus, he said that school taught that one of his ships had sunk off an island.

I said, ""that's it?"" and he said ""yes"".

I then looked at his homework and it included the Scholastic magazine which featured Columbus and sure enough, the article only said he had made it only to an island name Haiti. Over a dozen states no longer recognize Columbus Day, a creation of the Knights of Columbus back in 1934.

Even edgy [Mainstream whorporate news](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_mediacontrol.htm) is revising history now as truths become known as to the barbaric history of our country's ""founding"" when we genocided *over 97% of the Indian population* in conquest and brought millions of slaves across the Atlantic to work in the cotton and tobacco fields of the wealthy with names like Jefferson, Washington, Adams, etc.

This is 24/7 Wall St.'s list of the richest U.S. presidents:

&gt;**George Washington**, first president from 1789 to 1797  
 \- Net worth: $525 million In office  
His Virginia plantation, Mount Vernon, consisted of five separate farms on 8,000 acres of prime farmland, run by more than 300 slaves. His wife, Martha Washington, inherited significant property from her father. Washington made well more than subsequent presidents: his salary was 2% of the total U.S. budget in 1789.  
   
**Thomas Jefferson**, third president from 1801 to 1809  
 \- Net worth: $212 million  
Jefferson was left 3,000 acres and several dozen slaves by his father. Monticello, his home on a 5,000-acre plantation in Virginia, was one of the architectural wonders of its time. He made considerable money in various political positions before becoming president, but was mired in debt towards the end of his life.  
   
**James Madison**, fourth president from 1809 to 1817  
 \- Net worth: $101 million  
Madison was the largest landowner in Orange County, Va. His land holding consisted of 5,000 acres and the Montpelier estate. He made significant wealth as Secretary of State and president. Madison lost money at the end of his life due to the steady financial collapse of his plantation.Additionally, all these men had slaves, even until death. In fact, Thomas Jefferson pledged his slaves as assets upon his death against the massive debt he had incurred. ([source](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/02/16/richest-usa-presidents/1923739/))

Now these richest of the new country land baron's of the time were really interested in freedom for all of We the People as they pushed natives into reservations on the worst land possible and took slaves willingly to run their business'?

When they were done with the ""most important document in history"", the U.S. Constitution, they gave rights to only 7% of the population; White, Male and Puritan land owners. It took 75 years later for minorities to even get the right to vote and 120 years for women and now corporations of the wealthy run this country.

The truth is the barbaric ways of old Europe just morphed into new overlords who broke away from the King and Church to form their own Kingdoms and used deception and fraud to sell it to the masses.

My country 'tis of thee…

It may sound a little over the top but it's really no overstatement to say that much in our modern world is based on falsehood and fabrication.

We are told, for example, that Columbus 'discovered' America in 1492, yet there is plenty of evidence to suggest that others had visited America before Columbus:

&gt;including visitors from ancient Egypt, Phoenicia and medieval Europe.

Despite this modern authorities continue to push the line that ""Columbus discovered America.""

In point of fact *Columbus* *himself never even set eyes upon America*; the closest he got to the mainland of North America was Puerto Rico. However in the aftermath of Columbus's voyage John Cabot sailed from Bristol, England, which in turn opened the way for the first colony in Jamestown, Virginia and thus allowed the English to claim America as their own.

Yet there is considerable evidence that suggests that others from different cultures preceded Cabot and Columbus.

So one is forced to ask:

&gt;Why, when there is much to suggest that others from different cultures preceded Columbus, don't we hear more about this possibility being investigated?  
Could it be that certain powers have a vested interest in keeping our real history under wraps?

Whatever the answer the fact remains that a great deal has been unearthed which is completely at odds with conventional notions regarding the origins of what we know today as America.

In fact according to some contemporary authorities, the Native Americans encountered by the early settlers from England were not what they appeared to be.

They were indeed native to the Americas but they were not its original inhabitants, who according to various tribal legends, had disappeared eons before in a series of cataclysms.

**Columbus** **Day? True Legacy - Cruelty and Slavery**

Once again, it's time to celebrate Columbus Day. Yet, the stunning truth is: If [Christopher Columbus](http://www.creators.com/liberal/norman-solomon.html) were alive today, he would be put on trial for crimes against humanity.

[Columbus' reign of terror](http://hubpages.com/hub/Christopher-Columbus), as documented by noted historians, was so bloody, his [legacy so unspeakably cruel](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/History/Hero-making_LMTTM.html), that Columbus makes a modern villain like Saddam Hussein look like a pale codfish.

Question: Why do we honor a man who, if he were alive today, would almost certainly be sitting on Death Row awaiting execution?

If you'd like to know [the true story](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7D91031F937A35752C1A96F948260) about Christopher Columbus, please read on. But I warn you, it's not for the faint of heart.

Here's the basics. On the second Monday in October each year, we celebrate Columbus Day (this year, it's on October 11th). We teach our school kids a cute little song that goes: ""In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue."" It's an American tradition, as American as pizza pie. Or is it? Surprisingly, the true story of Christopher Columbus has very little in common with the myth we all learned in school.

[Columbus Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_day), as we know it in the United States, was invented by the [Knights of Columbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_day#United_States_observance), a Catholic fraternal service organization. Back in the 1930s, they were looking for a Catholic hero as a role-model their kids could look up to. In 1934, as a result of lobbying by the Knights of Columbus, Congress and President Franklin Roosevelt signed Columbus Day into law as a federal holiday to honor this courageous explorer.

Or so we thought...

There are several problems with this. First of all, Columbus wasn't the first European to discover America. As we all know, the Viking, [Leif Ericson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lief_Erikson) probably founded a Norse village on Newfoundland some 500 years earlier. So, hat's off to Leif.

But if you think about it, the whole concept of discovering America is, well, arrogant.

After all, the Native Americans discovered North America about 14,000 years before Columbus was even born! Surprisingly, DNA evidence now suggests that courageous [Polynesian adventurers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1965514/) sailed dugout canoes across the Pacific and settled in South America long before the Vikings.

Second, [Columbus wasn't a hero](http://www.nativeamericannetroots.net/diary/177/). When he set foot on that sandy beach in the Bahamas on October 12, 1492, Columbus discovered that the islands were inhabited by friendly, peaceful people called the Lucayans, Taínos and Arawaks. Writing in his diary, Columbus said they were a handsome, smart and kind people.

He noted that the gentle Arawaks were [remarkable for their hospitality](http://books.google.com/books?id=P8V7J5qm5-YC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).

&gt;""They offered to share with anyone and when you ask for something, they never say no,"" he said.

The [Arawaks had no weapons](http://socyberty.com/history/genocide-of-christopher-columbus/); their society had neither criminals, prisons nor prisoners. They were so kind-hearted that Columbus noted in his diary that on the day the Santa Maria was shipwrecked, the Arawaks labored for hours to save his crew and cargo.

The native people were so honest that not one thing was missing.

Columbus was so impressed with the hard work of these gentle islanders, that he immediately seized their land for Spain and enslaved them to work in his brutal gold mines. Within only two years, 125,000 (half of the population) of the original natives on the island were dead.

Shockingly, Columbus supervised the selling of native girls into [sexual slavery](http://www.danielnpaul.com/ChristopherColumbus.html). Young girls of the ages 9 to 10 were the most desired by his men. In 1500, Columbus casually wrote about it in his log.

He said:

&gt;""A hundred castellanoes are as easily obtained for a woman as for a farm, and it is very general and there are plenty of dealers who go about [looking for girls](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/History/Hero-making_LMTTM.html); those [from nine to ten are now in demand](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/History/Hero-making_LMTTM.html).""

He forced these peaceful natives work in his gold mines until they died of exhaustion.

If an ""Indian"" worker did not deliver his full quota of gold dust by Columbus' deadline, soldiers would [cut off the man's hands](http://www.criticalthink.info/Phil1301/lieshist.htm) and tie them around his neck to send a message. Slavery was so intolerable for these sweet, gentle island people that at one point, 100 of them committed [mass suicide](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Zinn/Columbus_PeoplesHx.html).

Catholic law forbade the enslavement of Christians, but Columbus solved this problem. He simply refused to baptize the native people of Hispaniola.

On his second trip to the New World, Columbus brought [cannons and attack dogs](http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/40/183.html). If a native resisted slavery, he would cut off a nose or an ear. If slaves tried to escape, Columbus had them burned alive. Other times, he sent attack dogs to hunt them down, and the [dogs would tear off the arms and legs](http://www.criticalthink.info/Phil1301/lieshist.htm) of the screaming natives while they were still alive.

If the Spaniards ran short of meat to feed the dogs, Arawak babies were [killed for dog food](http://www.unitednativeamerica.com/issues/statue.html).

Columbus' acts of cruelty were so unspeakable and so legendary - even in his own day - that Governor [**Francisco De Bobadilla** arrested Columbus ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus#Governorship_and_arrest)and his two brothers, slapped them into chains, and shipped them off to Spain to answer for their crimes against the Arawaks.

But the King and Queen of Spain, their treasury filling up with gold, pardoned Columbus and let him go free.

**Christopher** **Columbus' Crimes Against Humanity**

[**Source**](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/10/5/172256/007/64/394526)

To be sure, the real annihilations did not start until the beginning of Columbus' second voyage to the Americas in 1493 (1).

For while he had expressed admiration for the overall generosity of Indigenous People and considered the Tainos to be ""Very handsome, gentle, and friendly,"" he interpreted all these positive traits as signs of weakness and vulnerability, saying,

&gt;""if devout religious persons knew the Indian Language well, all these people would soon become Christians.""

As a consequence, he kidnapped some of the Tainos and took them back to Spain.

&gt;On his second voyage, in December 1494, Columbus captured 1,500 Tainos on the island of Hispaniola and herded them to Isabela, where 550 of ""the best males and females"" were forced aboard ships bound for the slave markets of Seville.  
   
Under Columbus's leadership, the Spanish attacked the Taino, sparing neither men, women nor children. Warfare, forced labor, starvation and disease reduced Hispaniola's Taino population (estimated at one million to two million in 1492) to extinction within 30 years.

[Furthermore, Columbus wrote a letter to the Spanish governor of the island, Hispaniola](http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0161-2492%28199221%2915%3A2%3C321%3AJF%3E2.0.CO%3B2-V&amp;size=LARGE&amp;origin=JSTOR-enlargePage), Columbus asked the governor the cut off the ears and the noses of any of the slaves who resisted being subjugated to slavery.

&gt;…It is estimated that 100 million Indians from the Caribbean, Central, South, and North America perished at the hands of the European invaders. Sadly, unbelievably, really, much of that wholesale destruction was sanctioned and carried out by the Roman Catholic Church and various Protestant denominations. (1: p.37)

One of Columbus' men, [**Bartolome De Las Casas**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas), was so mortified by Columbus' brutal atrocities against the native peoples, that he quit working for Columbus and became a Catholic priest.

He described how the Spaniards under Columbus' command cut off the legs of children who ran from them, to test the sharpness of their blades.

According to De Las Casas, [the men made bets](http://www.mit.edu/~thistle/v9/9.11/1columbus.html) as to who, with one sweep of his sword, could cut a person in half. He says that Columbus' men poured people full of boiling soap.

In a single day, De Las Casas was an eye witness as the Spanish soldiers dismembered, beheaded, or raped 3000 native people.

&gt;""Such inhumanities and barbarisms were committed in my sight as no age can parallel,"" De Las Casas wrote. ""My eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature that now [I tremble as I write](http://www.creators.com/liberal/norman-solomon.html).""

De Las Casas spent the rest of his life trying to protect the helpless native people.

But after a while, there were no more natives to protect. Experts generally agree that before 1492, the population on the island of Hispaniola probably numbered above [3 million](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%ADno_people#Population_decline). Within 20 years of Spanish arrival, it was reduced to only 60,000.

Within 50 years, [not a single original native inhabitant could be found](http://www.glencoe.com/sec/socialstudies/btt/columbus/native_peoples.shtml).

Columbus Day Poem Taught to U.S. School Children

&amp;#x200B;

|| In fourteen hundred ninety-twoColumbus sailed the ocean blue. ||
|:-|:-|:-|
|| He had three ships and left from Spain;He sailed through sunshine, wind and rain.||
|| He sailed by night; he sailed by day;He used the stars to find his way. ||
|| A compass also helped him knowHow to find the way to go. ||
||Ninety sailors were on board; Some men worked while others snored.||
|| Then the workers went to sleep;And others watched the ocean deep.||
|| Day after day they looked for land;They dreamed of trees and rocks and sand. ||
|| October 12 their dream came true,You never saw a happier crew !||
|| ""Indians! Indians!"" Columbus cried;His heart was filled with joyful pride ||
|| But ""India"" the land was not;It was the Bahamas, and it was hot .||
|| The Arakawa natives were very nice;They gave the sailors food and spice.||
|| Columbus sailed on to find some goldTo bring back home, as he'd been told. ||
|| He made the trip again and again,Trading gold to bring to Spain. ||
|| The first American? No, not quite.But Columbus was brave, and he was bright. ||

### Conventional History

Columbus Day first became an official state holiday in Colorado in 1906, and became a [federal holiday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States) in the United States in 1937, though people have celebrated Columbus' voyage since the colonial period.

In 1792, New York City and other U.S. cities celebrated the 300th anniversary of his landing in the New World.

President [**Benjamin Harrison**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison) called upon the people of the United States to celebrate Columbus Day on the 400th anniversary of the event. During the four hundredth anniversary in 1892, teachers, preachers, poets and politicians used Columbus Day rituals to teach ideals of patriotism. These *patriotic* rituals were framed around themes such as support for war, citizenship boundaries, the importance of loyalty to the nation, and celebrating social progress.

[Catholic immigration in the mid-19th century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_the_United_States#19th_century) induced discrimination from anti-immigrant activists.

Like many other immigrant communities, Catholics developed organizations to fight discrimination and provide insurance for the struggling immigrants. One such organization, the [Knights of Columbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_Columbus), chose that name in part because it saw Christopher Columbus as a fitting symbol of Catholic immigrants' right to citizenship: one of their own, a fellow Catholic, had discovered America.

Many [Italian-Americans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian-Americans) observe Columbus Day as a celebration of their heritage, the first occasion being in New York City on October 12, 1866.

Columbus Day was first popularized as a holiday in the United States through the lobbying of Angelo Noce, a first generation Italian, in Denver. The first official, regular Columbus Day holiday was proclaimed by Colorado governor Jesse F. McDonald in 1905 and made a statutory holiday in 1907.

In April 1934, as a result of lobbying by the Knights of Columbus, Congress and President [Franklin Delano Roosevelt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt) made October 12 a [federal holiday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holiday) under the name Columbus Day.

&gt;A Significant movement is spreading to rename this day 'Indigenous People's Day'. It could/would begin the healing to right the wrongs done to so many by the Conquistador's of white European Man, of which most are of our ancestral heritages.**Petition** [**here**](http://www.petitiononline.com/indian/petition.html)

Indigenous Natives lived with the land, air and waterways for thousands and thousands of years and never thought to own or despoil their Mother's and Father's who gave Life to all.

 Today, we are losing 200 species a day, globally, many waterways in the U.S., like the Navarro River where I live, no longer have salmon and trout come up the river or like the halibut, snapper, rock fish, salmon, etc. that are fished out along the West Coast.

What a huge step it would be for this country if we could begin to ask forgiveness, make reparations and put these proud Natives in places of leadership to teach us how to be good stewards and hold deep reverence and respect for Nature so that she may heal and provide for the next seven generations to come.

RECONSIDER COLUMBUS DAY AD

Columbus Day, a day that our government has deemed worthy of remembrance.

But with all due respect - with all due respect - with all due respect, there's an ugly truth that has been overlooked for way too long. Columbus committed heinous crimes against the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean and millions of natives throughout the Americas.

And Columbus set the stage for the slave trade in the New World. So, please, please reconsider if this is a man you want to honor. Reconsider if you want to celebrate the crimes of Columbus. It's not your fault; it happened a long time ago.

But remaining neutral and pretending like it didn't happen, or that it doesn't still impact us today?

So, please, take the day to learn the whole story: [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il5hwpdJMcg)

For christsakes, the guy C.C. thought he was in INDIA or so the story goes!

He then found the indigenous people so giving, he went back to get 14 more galleon ships to steal, pillage, rape and conquer the peaceful people throughout the Caribbean, South and North America's. For an excellent overview of the plight of the 'loser's' to American hegemony over the centuries read Howard Zinn's [A People's History of The United States](http://www.amazon.com/A-Peoples-History-United-States/dp/0060838655/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8), as told by those that suffered at the hands of the invaders.)

As the nation commemorates the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the so-called ""New World"" in 1492, indigenous activists at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado, are pushing for schools to teach the ""real history of the Americas"" and to celebrate indigenous culture.

""Columbus Day"" has long evoked sadness and anger amongst people of color, especially Native Americans, who object to honoring a man who opened the door to European colonization, the exploitation of native peoples, and the slave trade.

&gt;""The official story that Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas is ludicrous.  
   
A few miles from Edinburgh in Scotland today still stands Rosslyn Chapel, that holy grail of the Brotherhood Elite. It was built in the shape of a Templar cross by the St Clair-Sinclair family and is a mass of esoteric symbolism.  
   
The foundations were laid in 1446 and it was completed in the 1480s. How remarkable then that the stonework at Rosslyn includes depictions of sweetcorn and cacti which were only found in America and Christopher Columbus did not 'discover' that continent until 1492! How could this be? There is, in fact, no mystery. Christopher Columbus was not even nearly the first white person to land in the Americas.  
   
The Phoenicians, Norse, Irish, Welsh, Bretons, Basques and Portuguese, all sailed to America before him and so did Prince Henry Sinclair of Rosslyn, as documented in a rare book by Frederick I. Pohl called Prince Henry Sinclair's Voyage To The New World 1398.  
   
Sinclair made the journey with another Brotherhood bloodline, the Zeno family, one of the most prominent [Black Nobility families](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_blacknobil.htm) in Venice. Sinclair and Antonio Zeno landed in what we call Newfoundland and went ashore in Nova Scotia (New Scotland) in 1398…  
   
The Brotherhood had known about the Americas for thousands of years and Christopher Columbus was used to make the official discovery so that the occupation of the Americas could begin.""  
**David Icke, ""The Biggest Secret"" 178-9**

Columbus' supporters were European royalty and [the Templars](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_masonsknightstemplar.htm).

His father-in-law was a former Templar Knight and Catherine de Medici of the Illuminati bloodline (along with others) financed his voyage. Columbus' three ships sailed under the Templars Red Cross flag, used today by the Red Cross and Switzerland.

The royals also sent out fleets of conquistadors and swash-buckling pirates flying [the Skull and Bones](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_skullbones.htm) flag - their orders to rape, kill, and pillage all they could from the New World.

&gt;""The Skull and Bones cross used by the secret society comes from the pirate skull and cross bones.

**A Little Matter of Genocide - Ward Churchill**

[**Source**](http://www.monabaker.com/pMachine/more.php?id=A2068_0_1_0_M)

During the four centuries spanning the time between 1492, when Christopher Columbus first set foot on the 'New World' of a Caribbean beach and 1892, when the US Census Bureau concluded that there were fewer than a quarter-million indigenous people surviving within the country's boundaries, *a hemispheric population estimated to have been as great as 125 million was reduced by something over 90 percent*.

The people had died in their millions of being hacked apart with axes and swords, buried alive and trampled under horses, hunted as game and fed to dogs, shot, beaten, stabbed, scalped for bounty, hanged on meat-hooks and thrown over the sides of ships at sea, worked to death as slave laborers, intentionally starved and frozen to death during a multitude of forced marches and internments, and, in an unknown number of instances, deliberately infected with epidemic diseases. (p. 1)

Later in the book he gives a staggering estimate of the total who were 'ethnically cleansed':

&gt;'All told, it is probable that more than one hundred million native people were 'eliminated' in the course of Europe's ongoing 'civilization' of the western hemisphere.' (p. 86)

Although Ward Churchill has not written fully on the genocide against the Palestinians, he does place it within the global context of the present book, A Little Matter of Genocide, a book which leapt out at me from a display of books by and about native Americans in City Lights Book Store.

The author is an enrolled Keetoowah Cherokee and Professor of American Indian Studies in the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder and has been a leader of the Colorado Chapter of the American Indian Movement since 1972.

The title of the book is taken from a statement by **Russell Means**, founder of the American Indian Movement, who spoke of 'a little matter of genocide right here at home,' by which he meant the ongoing genocide against the American Indians which is still in progress.

**A Little Matter of Genocide**

The U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Comes Clean 185 years later

[**Source**](http://www.russellmeansfreedom.com/2009/bia-head-admits-to-american-indian-genocide/)

&gt;""Immediately upon its establishment in 1824, the Office of Indian Affairs was an instrument by which the United States enforced its ambition against the Indian nations. As the nation expanded West, the agency participated in the ethnic cleansing that befell the western tribes.  
   
War begets tragedy, but the deliberate spread of disease, the decimation of the bison herds, the use of alcohol to destroy mind and body, and the cowardly killing of women and children made for tragedy on a scale so ghastly that it cannot be dismissed as merely the inevitable consequence of the clash of competing ways of life.  
   
After the devastation of tribal economies, the BIA set out to destroy all things Indian by forbidding the speaking of Indian languages, prohibiting traditional religious activities, outlawing traditional government, and making Indians ashamed of who they were.  
   
Worst of all, the BIA committed these acts against the children entrusted to its boarding schools.  
   
The trauma of shame, fear, and anger has passed from one generation to the next, and manifests itself in the rampant alcoholism, drug abuse, and domestic violence that plague Indian country.  
   
The BIA expresses its profound sorrow for these wrongs, extends this formal apology to Indian people for its historical conduct, and makes promises for its future conduct.""

**The Canary Effect**

*The Canary Effect* is a 2006 documentary that looks into the effects of that the United States and its policies have on the Indigenous peoples (Native Americans) who are residents.

It premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and won the Stanley Kubrick Award at the 2006 Traverse City Film Festival (Michael Moore hosts).

The movie was directed by **Robin Davey** and **Yellow Thunder Woman**, who are both members of LA Based alternative pop group *The Bastard Fairies*.

Delving deeply into the often misunderstood and frequently over looked historic realities of the American Indian, *The Canary Effect* follows the terrifying and horrific abuses instilled upon the Indigenous people of North America, and details the genocidal practices of the US government and its continuing affects on present day Indian country.

Featuring interviews with the leading scholars and experts on Indian issues including controversial author Ward Churchill, the film brings together the past and present in a way never before captured so eloquently and boldly on film.

**The U.S. Government Native Indian Re-education Program**

**DENNIS BANKS:** I was in the boarding schools when punishment was very severe if you ran away.

This was during the early '40s. I was taken to a boarding school when I was four years old, and taken away from my mother and my father, my grandparents, who I stayed with most of the time, and just abruptly taken away and then put into the boarding school, 300 miles away from our home.

And, you know, the beatings began immediately, the - almost the de-Indianizing program. It was a terrible experience that the American government was experimenting with. And that was trying to destroy the culture and the person, destroy the Indian-ness in him and save the human being, save the - kill an Indian, save the man.

That was, you know, the description of what this policy is about, about trying to -

**AMY GOODMAN:** Now, the government ran the schools?

**DENNIS BANKS:** The U.S. government paid - of course, they ran a lot of the schools themselves, but they also delegated a lot of it to the Christians, Christian communities.

The Catholics had some. The Episcopalians had some. The Lutherans had some. Methodists had some. And so, it was like a complicit - there was complicity between the churches and the state in taking care of Indian problem, solving the Indian problem, and trying to change who we were.

**AMY GOODMAN:** Dennis, where had - where had you lived? Where had you lived, and where were you brought to school?

**DENNIS BANKS:** I lived on the federal - or, on the Leech Lake Indian Reservation, where I was born, in northern Minnesota. And I was taken to a boarding school 300 miles away to the south, southernmost part of Minnesota, the southwestern part, called Pipestone Indian School. I stayed there three years - six years -

**AMY GOODMAN:** And how -

**DENNIS BANKS:** Go ahead.

**AMY GOODMAN:** How did you communicate with your family? And how often did you get to see them? Did you get to talk to them?

**DENNIS BANKS:** Never. Never.

You know, they cut off all communication with your parents, and a lot of letters, which I found later in - I stayed there for six years without communicating to - with my parents at all. And finally, they let us go home for six years. Of course, we couldn't speak the language. We could speak only English and - what these young people were talking about.

But there was severe punishment for running away from that kind of system. I ran away. I kept running away. Almost once a week, I'd run away from those schools. They'd catch me. They'd bring me back to the school, beat me. And it was - it was terrible.

I mean, there was other kinds of punishment that we went through, as well. And it was - now that, it was a - that kind of experience, I still remember what it is like today. And I have a friend who has been - who had been my friend for over 70 years now, and we remember those days.

There were - we stuck together. A lot of people stuck together. Just being together, that's what saved a lot of us from terrible consequences of speaking. But eventually, they - you know, they kept beating me down, and I kept - so I started learning English, and I started learning who the presidents were. I started learning all that stuff.

And then they let me go home for 30 days. Six years. And I asked my mother, I said, ""Why didn't you write to me?"" And she - you know, and she says, ""I did."" But I never - I never questioned beyond that. And then there was - they sent me to another boarding school in North Dakota, another 200 miles away. I was there for three years.

And then, after that, same thing: no - only English, you know, corporal punishment. And then I went home for another 30 days, asked my mother, ""Why is it you didn't write to me again?"" She says, ""I did, and I did.""

Then they sent me to another boarding school in South Dakota further away, so another 400 miles. I kept running away from these schools. And I finally ran away from the last one, and I finally made it home.

And it wasn't 'til almost just three years ago when my daughter was - they were doing a documentary on Dennis Banks, and they found - they went to - in the federal depository records in Kansas City.

And she called me, and she says, ""Dad, we found"" - ""Dad,"" she said, ""we found your - we found your school records."" And I said, ""Bring them back."" So she brought them back, and I started looking at them. And she says, ""Dad, we also found something else.""

She handed me a shoebox. And I opened up the shoebox, and those were letters, letters from my mother. And I started opening them up, and I started reading them.

And in the second one, there was a letter to the superintendent of the school that said,

&gt;""Here is $5. Please send my children - my son back home to me.""

Post your best conspiracy theories. Here’s mine:

In 2015 there was a test done at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. It was headed by Ralph Baric.

https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/lab-made-coronavirus-triggers-debate-34502

The purpose of the lab test was to manipulate a bat coronavirus to see if it could infect humans. It was discovered that it could.

https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985

One of the people who co wrote the paper was a Chinese researcher by the name of Xing-Ye Gi. Google scholar shows Gi has written or co-written numerous papers on SARS, ebola and coronavirus.

https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=%22Xing-Yi+Ge%22&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_allsubj=all&amp;hl=en

Gi works in Wuhan, within the sole BSL-4 lab in the entire country. A Chinese national literally worked on modifying a bat coronavirus to infect humans, 100% confirmed. Hmm...

There are only 70 BSL-4 (Highest Level Biosafety research labs) in the world, and in China, a country of 1.4 Billion people, only 1 exists. Coincidentally, it happens to be in Wuhan. The people in Wuhan aren’t the only Chinese eating stuff like bat soup, this would have to be a pretty crazy coincidence since there are at least 9 cities larger than Wuhan and it could have appeared in any one of them, but it just happened to appear next to the sole bioweapon lab in the entire country.

https://www.nature.com/news/inside-the-chinese-lab-poised-to-study-world-s-most-dangerous-pathogens-1.21487

This article was written in 2017 about its construction, and was worried about the potential safety since this is China’s first attempt at such a lab, and it wasn’t receiving guidance from the rest of the world on its construction. The article also mentions one of the first viruses it will be working on is SARS. The Coronavirus is closely related to SARs from initial inspection. The article warned that this lab would likely be dual use, as China claims it only exists to help research and cure disease when in reality China also wants to get in the Bioweapon game with the other superpowers.

A Bioweapon escaping such a lab isn’t impossible, as Anthrax escaped a Soviet bioweapon lab in 1979 killing at least 100 people, but the true number is unknown as they denied it happened at all for more than a decade. Soviets lied saying it was due to tainted meat, and the KGB destroyed all hospital records and other evidence. They were extremely lucky with which way the wind was blowing, as if it blew the other way spores would have landed in a nearby city killing hundreds of thousands of people. Boris Yeltsin eventually admitted to the truth of this Biological Chernobyl.

SARS even escaped a Beijing lab twice!

Laboratory safety at the Chinese Institute of Virology under close scrutiny
Apr 26, 2004
The latest outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China, with eight confirmed or suspected cases so far and hundreds quarantined, involves two researchers who were working with the virus in a Beijing research lab, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday (April 26).
“We suspect two people, a 26-year-old female postgraduate student and a 31-year-old male postdoc, were both infected, apparently in two separate incidents,” Bob Dietz, WHO spokesman in Beijing, told The Scientist.
The woman was admitted to hospital on April 4, but the man apparently became infected independently 2 weeks later, being hospitalized on April 17. Both worked at the Chinese Institute of Virology in Beijing, part of China's Center for Disease Control.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2004/07/sars-crisis-topples-china-lab-chief

Now to speculate. I don’t think it is a completed bioweapon as China would likely have a vaccine ready for it to protect their people after deployment against an enemy, and it would likely be far more dangerous. Much more likely is that is an only partially complete bioweapon, a chimera SARS with aspects of other viruses thrown in as they experiment with creating the final product. This is what leaked. Since it is only an early prototype, there is no vaccine ready yet, and it will still be far more dangerous than a natural virus. This is also a huge reason for the coverup. If it gets out that China let a bioweapon escape, there will be an international shitshow. Unlike what other conspiracy theorists have speculated, I find it extremely doubtful that a bioweapon was released deliberately, as there is no believeable motive and this will inflict terrible damage on China economically.

This may not be just a tragic accident.

*For ex-pot kingpin, new trouble—health supplements*

“Jared Wheat has been on the government’s radar for more than two decades. Twenty years ago, he was convicted as a drug smuggler who operated a massive marijuana ring in the South. Now, Wheat must pay a $40 million judgment and recall health supplements that a judge says falsely claim to burn fat and cure erectile dysfunction.”

“Amazingly while he’s in jail, he decides he needs to make more money, sell more product,” Jim Kohm, associate director of the Enforcement Division at the FTC, told CNBC. ”He was calling the shots for the whole thing and he was doing so in jail.”

“In a plea bargain, the defendants admitted to operating a manufacturing facility in Belize that made generic versions of such pharmaceuticals as Xanax, Valium, Ambien, Vioxx, Zoloft, Viagra and Cialis and selling them over the Internet without requiring prescriptions.”

“The plea bargain recommended that Wheat receive a prison sentence of 37 months, but Judge Camp rejected that at a sentencing hearing last month, saying it was not severe enough for “the seriousness of the conduct.""

“The judge previously sentenced Hi-Tech officials Stephen D. Smith and Tomasz Holda to serve 27 months and 16 1/2 months, respectively. Holda’s sentence will be served consecutively with time he is now serving for a federal firearms offense.”

“Under a plea deal, three other defendants were sentenced to jail terms of 16 to 27 months; the judge found the 37 months for Wheat suggested in the plea was not harsh enough for his actions. During plea negotiations, prosecutors dropped allegations of racketeering, spiking supplements with ephedrine alkaloids and conspiracies of blackmail and murder.”

However I'm wondering if the arguments for gay marriage can be used to support other questionable romantic/sexual relationships such as incest or bestiality.  Take the phrase, ""love is love.""  That means anybody should be able to love whomever they want.  Is the government allowed to tell us who or who not to have sexual relations with?  For example, many years ago, we had the same reaction to gay marriage as we did to ""unusual relationships"" like mentioned before.  On a legal standpoint, I understand why bestiality and pedophilia are illegal, as one of the parties are unable to give consent.  But what about incest?  In this situation, both parties are able to give consent.  From what I understand, incest results to higher rates of genetic diseases and disabilities in children - especially brother/sister relationships - which is the only reason I can think of why it is illegal.  What if the factor of procreating are out of the equation - both parties are in a situation where neither want or in risk of having children, eliminating inbred children?  In this case the only argument against incest is that it's morally wrong in the eyes of the general public.  Do you think such relationships could be legalized in the future?  Consider that only decades ago, the general consensus was that gay marriage was morally wrong.

Chapter 17: Project MKUltra

January 28, 2020

In 2018 I completed my video work and I have not returned to video since. This does not mean that I will not create video projects for myself in the future, but what it does mean is that the mission for my video project was completed. With ""This Book Is a Game"" now complete, my writing work is coming to its finalisation. This does not mean that after this book that I will not write in my future. But what it does mean is that my mission for my writing project is coming to its completion. From 2018 to 2019 I finalised everything that I needed to say in video. And now I am finalising everything that I need to say in writing. I likely will do video and writing in my future. But it will serve a different purpose. Like stated in the last chapter, I am not required to perform the same monotonous task again and again like the brainwashed populace of our world. Once I have completed the work, it is done and I never have to do it again. I have so much work available that people can spend years watching and reading it and likely still have more of it to experience. It would take a really hardcore fan to complete my work. So what is the point of making more of it, especially when I have stated all of the fundamentals of what I am presenting? There is no point. The point is that my work is coming to its completion. And it will work for me for the rest of my life with little to no effort. I was smart. Actually, God was smart.

After my ex-wife left me, I was extremely depressed. I almost killed myself but right before the action, I literally passed out on the floor. This is when God literally revealed Himself to me. I spoke with God about my life and God revealed to me the next ten years of it. But what a task God assigned me! How was I, as one person, to accomplish all that God had set out for me? I asked God if I had a choice. God told me that I could end my life at this moment, for my choice was to follow the vision God had given me or commit suicide. I asked if those were my only options. They were. So I was to choose ten years of hardship or suicide. I chose the ten years of hardship not because that was what I wanted but because as a child I gave my life to God. Since it is God's life and not mine, I chose to endure the next ten years. For if I murdered myself, I would be destroying God's property. I could not bring myself to destroy God's property. So I lived to see another day and recommitted my life to God. However, I was not happy about this arrangement because I knew what was to come.

And now, ten years later, I am free. I am an independent game developer and I am not required to obtain and maintain a typical job. I spend a lot of my time playing digital games and this is now considered my work because the more games I play, the more ideas I can integrate into my own game. I am not speaking of ripping other games off, as you will see in my game Ivory Heart. This game is incredibly unique. However, other games do assist in the creation of my own game. I can utilise techniques from other games to integrate into my game.

I have a method for recording one's thoughts that was passed on to me from a high. Just start writing your heart out about all the things you care about in life. You can write with a phone or a camera. Both are effective mediums to collect and convey information. Mix it up and use writing to assist your video work. You are not locked in a box.

And what are you to record? The answer is your heart. Imprint something on to this world in which you will be proud of. Use the educational ladder to convey your messages. But a heart is extremely complex and there are many sides to it. Yes, this is true which is why it is extremely important that you document it. Because you are extremely unique and you and your achievements deserve to be documented and showcased.

The development of Ivory Heart the video game is going very well. I can envision the game in my head. In addition, I have already created beautiful 3D environments to explore. Soon I will be working on quests. But this type of video game is not at all easy to create because it will have no violence in it. A game like this has never before been created. That is the advantage of being a philosopher. What you produce is incredibly unique and you will have no competitors. For this is not just a game to collect book chapters. The chapters are complimentary materials for the quests in the game. The quests are not linked to the information in the books. The chapters are the rewards for successfully completing quests. The chapters will in no way hold the game hostage. Because the learning will occur when interacting with the characters and performing their assigned duties.

Ivory Heart is a game created to inspire young girls to live a life of virtue quite literally saving the world. The heroine is the saviour of the game world. But her quests do not end in-game. The quests will be designed to teach the player what actions they need to make in real life in order to make a difference in this world. Ivory Heart is a finishing school for young girls. It teaches the ways of wisdom through an electronic classroom environment. It provides the player with a great deal of study materials that they can bring with them wherever they go. That is why it is important that I release my game on the Nintendo Switch. My game is being created with portability in mind. My game will provide all of the study materials required to successfully complete all its courses. My game is the future of the classroom. Physical buildings where school shooters love to play are so old school. I am literally converting the physical buildings into a digital atmosphere. My game will stand as a solid attempt to reinvent the ways in which we educate our young.

What teachers do you want to teach your children? Children deserve the best teachers possible but unfortunately our world is filled with terrible teachers. The best teachers will create new and innovative methods to teach their content. Eventually, this will put most teachers out of a job. This is a good thing and not a bad thing as we remove all the terrible teachers from the world and replace them with innovative creators. The world of our future education implementation is digital and it is now time to purge all who are analogue. The teachers of face to face are now obsolete. For we now have digital warriors who educate much more efficiently and effectively than the physical classroom environment. Who will you choose to educate your child? A gunman? A teacher that is so bad at their job that they couldn't even escape the nine to five? The teachers of the future are those who educate worldwide and not those who focus on their physical environment. How effective is a teacher that can only reach twenty kids? My reach is infinite and repeatable. For I live in the clouds. I only have to teach a lesson once and it is publicly available for all who are interested to learn from. 

The truth is that the education system is exploiting your kids. Yes, they babysit for you, but that is about how far their helpfulness goes. They know about online education and they know that they could reach the entire world if they wanted to. But they want your money and a scope like that is not profitable. That means that they value money above the well-being of your children. I truly care about your children and I could care less about your money. Who is the better teacher? Why would you allow this to go on? The answers are right in front of you. Our modern day education system is a mechanic in society utilised to brainwash the population. The point of school is to get your child into a nine to five. Does damning your child to the nine to five life sound like a loving thing to do? Of course it isn't. But here is the truth: most parents do not truly love their children. Just as the school exploits children, so do their parents. As children grow, parents begin to wonder what they can get out of their children. Most children of this world are slaves to their parents. And it is even common ""wisdom"" that parents should not be friends with their children. How ridiculous is that? If a parent of mine doesn't want to be my friend then I don't want to be their child.

We live in an age where that is very possible. If you have terrible parents, renounce them. If they do not have your best interest in mind, then flee from them. I was emancipated from my parents at the age of fifteen. They were taking actions against me that hurt me on a regular basis. Do not put up with that regardless if they are your parents or not. You deserve respect and if your parents are not going to give it to you, then don't give it to them. Just because they are your parents doesn't mean that they are family. In this day and age we choose our family. Who is my family? Those who do the works of God are my family. Does my family do the works of God? No, they do their own works. It is easy to see who does the works of God by analysing their works and its attachment to God. If their works are not associated with God, then they are not doing the works of God. See in what name they proclaim their works. For it is that name that is written to their hearts. And that name is usually money.

CIA-controlled responses show desperate efforts to control the fall so that they can control the damage and starting positions of players after »reboot«.

BTW, YT channels like ADVChina etc are talking about  Xi’s talk about the market reboot and new beginning that is coming. But they fail to interpret that in the global scope – Xi/CCP seems to be saying that »reboot« is coming globally.

This point will be used for the rise of new, »Fourth Reich«, this time with most of the »bugs« and snags of the previous versions avoided, removed or worked around.

It’s not clear if that is original intent of GWO or just compromise that they are expected to accept along the way. Formally, this is to be known as new EU with its armed forces, space program (WeltraumWaffe?) etc. Or perhaps they count on this new EU only as a temporary step ( just so it isn’t too obvious) after which FR,IT, etc are expected to leave and leave Germany with (national) socialism of some sort, bunch of vasal states on the south and east of the Europe up to Bulgaria etc.

857,Throwaway03220,ev408i,"Is it just me or is news about the US Air Force Air Combat Command plane crashing / possibly being shot down by members of the Taliban in Afghanistan's [eastern Ghazni province](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPSH8KqX4AEUXoL?format=jpg&amp;name=small) being suppressed by most major US news media outlets?

From what I've been able to find via Twitter searches on the topic it was initially reported by media yesterday that the plane was not one of ours, but instead was a passenger jet belonging to Iranian Ariana Airlines. The airline quickly denied this claim stating all their flights were safe and accounted for.

Shortly thereafter a spokesman for the Taliban, a man by the name of Zabihullah Mujahid, posted on his Twitter *(honestly didn’t know terrorists used Twitter spokespersons until today)* that insurgents with the group had shot down the plane and that it had confirmed deceased CIA officials on board. 

Following Mujahid's announcement, U.S. officials reported to [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/27/799967351/u-s-plane-goes-down-in-afghanistan-prompting-wave-of-questions-contradictions) that the plane was a U.S. Bombardier E-11A, and that it had “two people on board, both of whom died in the crash” after the plane went down due to what they’re calling “mechanical problems.”

In culmination of all of this, Russian media, citing Russian intel, [is now saying](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/top-cia-chief-behind-soleimani-21375358) that the plane shot down yesterday was carrying CIA Chief Michael D’Andrea, the head of CIA operations against Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq, who is said to have helped plan America's drone strike on Iranian General Qassem Soleimani earlier this month. This revelation is allegedly being reported on Iranian state TV.

You can verify for yourself via the photos I’ve linked below that the USAF plane seen in the videos of the wreckage is more than likely the same plane in the pictures.

**Photographs of the plane and wreckage:**

- [Twitter Video 2 at USAF Plane Wreckage Site](https://mobile.twitter.com/usmilitaryupd8/status/1221789729861009414)

To my untrained eyes, the fuselage of the plane appears to have suffered more than just “mechanical problems,” although that term itself is rather vague and nondescript. That being said, all pilots are trained to land planes even when there are mechanical issues with their aircraft.

**These pertinent questions remain to be answered:**

1. Why wasn’t there breaking news about this on the major news networks yesterday?

2. Why would you fly that large of an aircraft over Taliban controlled area, especially with only two people on board?

3. Is Michael D’Andrea confirmed deceased?",conspiracy,Major US News Media organizations not reporting on the USAF Air Combat Command plane that crashed in Afghanistan yesterday

So in 2nd Enoch's book from old testamet you can read that ""God""(God could mean more advanced civilisation looking like us IMO) shown him Sun cycles,Moon cycles,Sun and Moon names and what is very curious is 364 days year cycle in Chapter 1 Verse 16.

We calculated that year is \~ 365.242189 days long.

Maya civilisation for example were able to calculate it being 365 days too.

Was ""God"" not right and teached Enoch wrong?

What do you think about possibility of every next year cycle being longer than previous one?Maybe Vatican and THEY made us believe year is 365,24 days long and we don't even question it anymore because we are ""sure"" year is 365 days long so whou would waste time and do research to find out year is truly 365 days long?

I think there is also a posibility of every Earth cycle being slightly longer than previous one.I'm no astronomist or ""scientist"" but this is how I would see it.

Enoch was 7th generation after Adam.We don't know exactly when Adam was created,5000 years ago,10 000,20 000,50 000?We don't know it.

[Maya civilization existed](https://www.ancient.eu/Maya_Civilization/) \~7000-2000 BC only God knows when they were able to calculate 365 days cycle.They could be able to do it 5000BC or 3000BC,we don't know it for sure.

If we assume Enoch lived before Maya civilization and at his time year was 364 days long then Maya civilization was created few thousand years after him and for them year now has 365 days.Few thousand years pass and now we calculate year is 365,24 days long.How do we explain it then?It looks like every next earth cycle becomes longer,is Earth moving slightly further away from sun every year?

Often the discussion on this forum revolves around the elite class, and how they differ from the masses.  

There is only one difference.  The elites on this planet have been privy to the true nature of consciousness, and human existence.  The true human history.  They wield this knowledge as a weapon against the ""unwashed masses"".

How does it make you feel to know that privileged humans on this planet have access to universal truths that govern our existence, but refuse to share that knowledge with all humanity?  Truths which could set you free from your own existential crises, and allow you to live a life free from the burdens of oppression and slavery.  Technologies which could heal your illnesses, and rekindle your spirit, imagination, and drive to find purpose in you're own life.  

They think you aren't smart enough, important enough, or powerful enough to know the true meaning of existence.  They think they are acting in you're best interest.  They think you need to be herded, coerced, and lied to in order to create ""a system which works for everyone"" all while hiding the true nature of human life from those who need to understand it the most.  They honestly believe that it is necessary for you to be repressed and lied to, for you're own well being.       

They allow suffering on a global scale, just to keep the status quo, and keep things controllable.  They don't think you are capable of self determination.  They think you need to be managed as if you are livestock.  They think you will not be able to fully comprehend the nature of our existence, even though our creator embedded in each and every one of us, the desire to know the truth, and understand the significance of the smallest action and feelings.  They have convinced themselves, that there needs to be an elite class of humans ruling all others.  They will lie, murder, and erase history to keep this status quo.

Consequently, China might become the leader in a new kind of technology, that every nation will face in the future, and have an undeniable excuse for customers to buy their 5G and robotics technology.

This is worse than you think! 



The governments and tv reports are hiding the truth about the virus and how fast it spreads and how strong it is.

We all see in the Televisions, articles and in websites about the latest happenings in China. But that is not exactly true. 


People inside Wuhan and other provinces are suffering from the effects of the virus. 

People from Wuhan tells their experience in the social media, some of the videos are shutdown by the authority, and posts are being tracked by them.

A busy road with so much people becomes ghost town in just days.

Hospitals and doctors are also suffering from the effects of the virus.

They lack power and equipments to function well and their strengths are also deteriorating.

In fact doctors are also dying because of the virus, they sacrificed themselves for the people, to cure them. 

They work endlessly to prevent the virus and the spreading of this. 

Some of them are treated poorly by patients and other doctors and nurses are being spit by other patients, wanting to them die also.

Patients were suffering due to the lack of doctors and nurses and also spaces in the Hospitals.

These situations are not being announced and declared by the government though they reported that they will build 10 Hospitals in 10 days for the Victims of the Virus.

It's a good news for the people.

Other nurses and doctors reported that they were also lacking of disposable suits and masks.


If the reports of these people are true then this Country will die because of their Pride.

I believed that other countries are willing to help them if they will allow them


So far there are some reports that some people recovered completely from the virus, but we dont know how true is it.

They dont want to cause widespread panic across the world, so Chinese government and Western governments are keeping information regarding the virus and potential pandemic very quiet. This is worrying seeing as the infection rate is rapidly increasing, started in the highest populated country in the world, the strict quarantine and hazmat suits/ check points should be a very big scary awakening. Parts of China are very much looking apocalyptic, very similar to something you would seen in a zombie Hollywood film.

Wuhan is a very large city with a population over 11 million, the entire city is under quarantine lockdown. Very serious action to take for a virus the media is saying not to worry about. With a population of 11 million and a virus symptom free period is a deadly combination. How many people have the virus without realising, and can also still spread the virus without knowing.

Wuhan is also home to a biological studying facility, recently testing Flu virus. Very interesting how this has emerged 2miles down the road to 'bio-weapon factory'

At this point of this post, 106 people dead. This statistic is MUCH higher, most likely in the thousands, loads of video footage leaked online from Chinese citizens displaying overcrowded hospitals, dead people in the street, families screaming and torn apart due to infected being taken and quarantined and instant cremation. 

The global elite (SATANIC CABAAL) have been planning a mass de-population static for many years. The rise of AI is in perfect timing for the replacement of mankind as we no longer are of use to the elite in power. A virus they have manufactured which only the rich and powerful/chosen are given the antidote/vaccine.

The virus has began from some sort of animal, evidence is pointing towards a snake. Virus that start from animals are incredibility difficult to battle, due to the body having no natural defence and can very easily and quickly become deadly. 

A very well timed Netflix series regarding global flu pandemic which realised bang on time with the spread of the infection. Perfect example of predictive programming.

I recommend to just be precautions to stock up on food/tinned goods, medication and water(atleast a 2 week supply). If this was to become a pandemic, medical supplies and produce will become very limited especially to smaller towns/cities. Bigger cities with higher population will recieve the priority of goods and medicine. Hospitals will be overwhelmed with medical admissions. Buy a battery powered radio system, to keep in the loop if all media has a black out.  Also keep a small amount of cash as back up, as if S\*\*\* hits the fan, banks, ATMs and pretty much anything will be closed.

890,Jam102,ev2o5p,"Just a thought that occurred to me.

There's lots of information and theories about why we have so many systems in place along with many theories; population control, mind alteration, dominance etc etc.

However, what if all these theories are inherently wrong, and we've been looking at it the wrong way altogether.

Instead of a secret kabal of shadowy figures, systematically controlling everything like a chess game - what if we have innately created a system of control over the period of human nature, that allows us to control and limit our natural predatory and animalistic nature.

The thought first occurred to me when I watched a film based off a real social experiment. Most of you probably know about it:

Around 25 people were taken to a prison like building. Half became guards, half prisoners. With no interference from a controlling body, the guards quite quickly devolved into tormenting, abusing, dehumanising and eventually killing one of the prisoners. (really good film, Adrian Brody, Forrest Whittaker, check it out).

It led me to question how inherently good we actually are. You see the ""systems"" we have in place are constantly reminding us of moral goodness. The act of charity, of kindness. Would we need to be reminded so much so, if we were already inherently good.

OR

Are the systems we so often deride as controlling and oppressive, the very reason we're able to live in a functioning society, albeit with many problems, but still functioning.

It's quite sad but it seems like something horrible about a patient being mistreated and dying because of this is in the news frequently. I myself have spent lots of times in hospitals this last year and let me tell you first hand, it does not matter if you are old or young these hospitals and their workers will let you die before they give a shit about treating you.

Go in with a life-threatening emergency and literally have to wait 24 hours to get a proper hospital room (IF YOU'RE LUCKY) most times they will just turn you away. Being paraded with questions from dozens of different personnel, do these co-workers not communicate with one another, do they lack elementary communication skills?

Hard to believe right? Well there's a lot of ""who cares, not my problem"" attitude from A LOT of the personnel working at hospitals, it's fucking pathetic. Most treat it like any other job just trying to get a paycheck, and most young doctors are completely incompetent and seem to lack an ounce of common sense or education.

What kind of education are these new hires receiving before being thrown into the workplace literally not knowing anything. Is this more of an education problem, money allocation problem, or just how the healthcare system has seemed to shape up?

In all those months spent around hospitals.. out of the approximately 50 employees I had personally come in contact with I can safely say that about 3 of them seemed to know what they were doing, competent, caring, compassionate, and trying to make a difference (all older with what seemed like a lot of knowledge and experience in the profession). Every single young employee or employee with under lets say 20 years experience was a complete moron and didn't seem to give a flying fuck about the well being of anybody but themselves.

* usually that secondary channel is NFC. It can be  triggered by a coded pulse and its signal is meant to be received with Software Defined Radio or similar device.

This is a bit of a word dump, and I'm on mobile so excuse my shit formatting, I just want to touch base with this community on this one.

I'm going to preface this by stating that I assume everyone reading this knows the current situation with the Hong Kong, and *many* other countries around the planets protests, Epstein ""dying"", and the state of unrest involving society these days.

Also, on a personal note. I have an 8 year old child that just came back from Vietnam two and a half weeks ago. And she has a virus that started kicking in about half a week ago. The docs are saying it's just a normal respiratory infection. 

Anyway. To the meat of this. 

I'm throwing around the idea that this pandemic is a diversion, but possibly a culling tactic as well. 

If people start catching this en masse? That is a huge red flag, and I'm getting the feeling that we are being predisposed to be okay with it.

Cities being quarantined is fucking insane in the first place, but if we start seeing it outside of China.. I'm pretty sure you all know what that is the prefix to.

On top of this, I'm thinking about the mass protests around the world regarding civil rights. 

We were (in my opinion) getting pretty close to the whole unified ""eat the rich"" moment that everyone that is paying attention has been waiting for. 

Now everyone who is following this (possibly man made pandemic) is looking out for themselves and their borders. 

In my opinion, this is classic divisiveness, on a global scale.

 I'm not sure if what I'm trying to articulate is what's going on, but I'd like to hear anyone's thoughts about this idea who has read this far. 

Also! If anyone reading this is in a country that is currently having any kind of protests, I would love to hear anything from the ground.

*Some time ago, Justin was talking in a church, and he was talking about how he knew a guy that was supposedly sexually abused, some people believe that he was actually talking about himself. 

*L.A Reid, he worked with Justin Bieber when he was a kid and he said that Justin was ""as beautiful as a woman could be"", while this could be just pure coincidence and nothing do with this and just a weird creepy comment, it doesn't help that he was accused of sexual harrasment.

*While this could be pure coincidence, the image for ""Yummy"" just happens to have the letters made out of pizza, and some people think he's did this to refer to pizzagate.

I still frequent mainstream media outlets like the [New York Times ](https://www.nytimes.com/) and [Reuters](https://mobile.reuters.com/) but I take everything that I read there with a grain of salt. News headlines and articles are often *framed* in a way by mainstream media in order to influence more than to inform and headlines  often tend toward biases and often the meat of the articles under biased headlines don’t correlate with what the headlines state or infer. 

An often used trick is to align pictures alongside headlines and articles which are meant to portray through pictures the bias or intent the outlet wants to infer—you’ll see a headline or article about *Y candidate* which may be unfavorable to said candidate and alongside will be a picture of *Y candidate* looking down sadly or with a frown or fraught look on their face. “The Walls Are Closing In On Trump” with a picture of Trump—one of hundreds snapped by paparazzi and media photographers within mere seconds—seemingly looking fraught or scared.

982,BWet00,euzxft,"I have spent far too much time researching Kobe's death. Held off on theorizing until now and am going to keep it short - as there are a lot of other details I found surrounding his death that are ominous and suggest foul play (Island Express in particular). I am convinced Kobe Bryant was a blood sacrifice. The parallels between his death and Whitney Houston was the capper for me. 

Timing of Kobe's death:

* Less than 24h after LeBron passes him on all-time scoring
* Right before the Grammys - oddly enough held at Staples Center
* Grammys were a public mega-ritual hidden in plain sight. A bunch of Satanists and Luciferianists performing with hellfire in the background while holding his jersey.
* ""Passing of the torch"" to LeBron

Whitney Houston:

* A major icon in music industry. Found dead at Beverly Hills in LA.  
* At exact same location, few floors below, a pre-Grammy award party was taking place w 800+ guests. 
* The following day, the 2012 Grammys took place and was tainted with her death. 
* It was nothing short of another public mega ritual. 
* Creepy, satanic, symbolism galore with Whitney's ""replacement"", Jennifer Hudson, \*literally\* placed in the spotlight.   Passing of the torch. 

Mega, multicultural icons ""passing the torch"", whose deaths cause shockwaves around the world. MKUltra and Spirit Cooking freaks in the cesspool that is Hollywood/entertainment feasting on the powerful energy, performing mega-rituals with literal hellfire in the background.
