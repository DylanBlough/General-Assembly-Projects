Who is talking about the far east? The EHG lived in Eastern Europe. SHG are the result of EHG migrating into Scandinavia, the WSH are the result of EHG males and CHG females mixing in eastern Europe.

The EHG is probably the most relevant population because they were the first to have the derived allele of SLC45A2 and a good amount of Europeans have more eastern than western HG ancestry. And the 45A2 gene is the most relevant here, because it is exclusive to light skinned people, whereas SLC24A5 is found in plenty of populations who you would not typically describe as light.

Welcome to **/r/History**!

This post is getting rather popular, so here is a friendly reminder for people who may not know about our rules.

**We ask that your comments contribute and be on topic.** One of the most heard complaints about default subreddits is the fact that the comment section has a considerable amount of jokes, puns and other off topic comments, which drown out meaningful discussion. Which is why we ask this, because /r/History is dedicated to knowledge about a certain subject with an emphasis on discussion.

We have a few more rules, which you can see in the sidebar.

As we hope you can appreciate, the Holocaust can be a fraught subject to deal with. While don't want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the /r/History mods have created this brief overview. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.

##What Was the Holocaust?
The Holocaust refers to the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.

##But This Guy Says Otherwise! 
Unfortunately, there is a small, but vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as ""Revisionists"", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *""entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.""*

It is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.

##So What Are the Basics?  
Beginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.
First only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler’s approval.

The early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. 

By early 1942, the ""Final Solution"" to the so-called ""Jewish Question"" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.

Construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  ""Reinhard"" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Chełmno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.

##The Camps  
There were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as ""extermination through labor"". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and ""allowed"" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.

Although some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.

The Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Bełżec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.

Several camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.

##How Do We Know?  
Running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz.

*From a letter from major Zweinbrücken, part of The Rochambeau force that landed in Newport, America, in July 1780, Hans Axel von frezen: ""the Locals complain, so to speak, of only one thing. Our discipline is remarkable, but they wonder beyond measure why we don't plunder them, as the British and their own troops did."".*

And then they remembered France. It was very entertaining and amusing:

The first shipment of weapons arrived in Boston in September 1777. It included 200 guns, as well as equipment and weapons for 25 thousand people. The total amount of this delivery was 5 million livres. According to the agreement signed by the American representative Silas Dean, ""the colonies will pay for supplies from France after the war, excluding tents, bedding, woolen cuts, etc., which must be paid immediately."" 

Initially, the Americans asked for a loan for 8 months, the French agreed, and even provided the opportunity to pay for weapons by barter: ""we would ask you, gentlemen, to send us next spring, if possible, 10 or 12 thousand heads of pigs, as well as tobacco from Virginia, preferably of the best quality."" 

Beaumarchais wrote to the king and Vergennes that trade with the Americans was, among other things, a profitable business. Like, we invest a million-in the spring we get two from the sale of their products in Europe, then we invest two – we get four, etc. 

But you can imagine the astonishment of both Beaumarchais and the French government when the ships came back empty. The Americans didn't ship anything to the French. Beaumarchais was simply dejected: ""there is no news From America, no tobacco. One word - despondency."" 

The problem was Arthur Lee. The latter rightly considered himself the Creator of these deliveries, because he threw Beaumarchais this idea, and delivered a letter to Congress, so Lee did not like that all further business Vergennes conducted with Silas Dean. 

And Lee wrote back to Congress with a small amount of money that the military supplies that the French will deliver to you may not be paid for, they say, it is a completely free gift from the French king to American patriots. 

The French requested Congress, which responded with Lee's words: ""Monsieur de Vergennes has repeatedly assured us that payment for the goods sent to Beaumarchais will not be required. Besides, Beaumarchais himself is not a merchant, but a political spy working for the French king and the French government."" 

Once again, a million was given by France, a million by Spain, a million by French merchants, and Beaumarchais borrowed another two million from friends and acquaintances, promising to return it with interest. As a result, the spy could not pay off governments or personal debts. 

Now Congress has requested Vergennes himself. The Congress, in turn, asked Lee, and Lee replied that there was nothing to pay, and Beaumarchais and Dean demanded money because they wanted to fill their own pockets, bypassing the kings of France and Spain. Not knowing who to believe, the Americans decided simply-we will not pay.

In Russia, this steamer is known for its history. Periodically, there is swearing on the topic of its sinking. 

Here's another unknown tragedy for You: 

At about 17: 00 on November 6, 1941, the ship ""Armenia"" left the port of Sevastopol, evacuating the personnel of several military hospitals and residents of the city. According to various estimates, there were from 4.5 to 10 thousand people on Board. The last flight of the ""Armenia"" was led by Lieutenant Vladimir Yakovlevich Pleaseski.

The ship was carrying several thousand wounded soldiers and evacuated citizens. The ship was also loaded with the staff of the main hospital of the black sea fleet and a number of other military and civil hospitals (23 hospitals in total), as well as the management and employees of the Artek pioneer camp, their family members and part of the party leadership of Crimea. Loading of evacuees was in a hurry, the exact number is unknown.

At 2: 00 on November 7, the ship arrived in Yalta, where it took on Board several hundred more people and some cargo. At 8:00, the ship left the port.

At 11: 25 a.m., the ship was attacked by a single German Heinkel He-111 torpedo boat belonging to the 1st squadron of air group I / KG28 (commander Oberst Ernst-August Roth). The German combat log has an entry about the attack.

Officially, in Soviet times, it was believed that about 5 thousand people were killed, at the beginning of the XXI century, estimates were increased to 7-10 thousand people. Only eight were saved. The ""Armenia"" disaster is one of the largest in world history in terms of the number of victims.

It was a perfectly prepared operation, of course. But the Belgians did strange things and were very unlucky. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The last hours before the assault on Eben Emael evoke a steady sense of déjà vu with the night of June 21-22, 1941. the Belgian military attache in Germany on may 9, 1940, at 19.00, warned the High command of the Belgian army about the possible start of war with Germany. This warning was not the only one in recent days: before that, reports of a possible attack had come from the French government and even Pope Pius XII. However, the Belgian command did not start notifying the troops until 22: 30. Perhaps this was due to the fact that the alarm was not the first, before the rise of troops on alert was in November 1939, once in January and twice in April* [*1940.as*](https://1940.as) *a result, Fort Eben Emael received a warning only at 0.30 on may 10. The commandant \[172\] of the Fort, major Jottrand, arrived at the command post at 1.00. At 2.00 am, Jottrand ordered the dismantling of two administrative buildings located outside the Fort, not far from the entrance. Formally, they closed the sector of fire at one of the casemates, and according to the instructions they were required to remove property from them, and the buildings themselves were leveled. Due to the lack of people, calculations of the Fort's closest firing points were used at this event. This order had fatal consequences: one of the first to weaken the calculations of the machine-gun casemate and the turret of the 75-mm guns that controlled the Fort's territory. On the other hand, major Jottrand reasonably believed that he had time, since before reaching Eben Emael, the Germans still had to overcome part of the territory of Holland on the way from Aachen to Maastricht.*

&amp;#x200B;

*The chain of circumstances that opened the ""green street"" to German paratroopers did not end with the diversion of forces to dismantle the huts. According to the established procedure, the towers of 75 mm guns were to be fired blank. The ""Tower North"" crew was dismantling the houses, and the"" Tower South "" guns had strikers removed. They were dismantled during training sessions in the previous days. It was necessary to go for the drummers to the warehouse through the endless underground galleries of the Fort. It was only at 3.25 that the first blanks were fired. They immediately ignited the camouflage net, blinding the dome's periscope. The shooting was stopped and several people were sent to clean the periscope's field of view. At 3.35 am, two German airfields were already flying u-52 transports with DFS 230 gliders in tow. By that time, the ""Tower North"" 75-mm guns were without the necessary calculation for firing, ""Tower South"" was able to shoot, but did not have a single shot of buckshot ready. There was only one non-commissioned officer and four enlisted men in the Northern machine-gun casemate protecting the territory of Fort Mi-Nord \[173\]. Ammunition was stored in sealed boxes that protected it from corrosion. It was strictly forbidden to open the boxes without a special order. Moreover, when the commander of one of the Fort's casemates opened a box of ammunition during the previous rise of the garrison, he was subjected to disciplinary action. It's elusive, isn't it?*

&amp;#x200B;

*When the gliders approachi*ng the Fort were spotted by the Fort's observers, everything was ready for the drama that soon unfolded. The last smear just a minute before the landing of the paratroopers on Eben Emael was made by captain van der over, who at 4.20 gave all the casemates of the Fort the conditional signal ""General attack "" instead of""massive attack"". The ""General attack"" signal meant an attack from the surrounding area, and ""massive attack"" meant an attack from all directions. In the latter case, the casemates that protected the Fort's territory were put in readiness. The machine guns were to be loaded, and buckshot shots were to be applied to the guns. The last few minutes were irretrievably lost. The reflection of the attack by anti-aircraft machine guns was also smeared. Initially, the gliders were mistaken for allied reconnaissance aircraft. When the crosses became clearly visible on the gliders gliding silently in the pre-dawn haze, the maxims opened heavy fire, but two of the four machine guns soon jammed. The gliders were so low that one of them shot down an anti-aircraft machine gun with its wing. One by one, nine DFS 230s began to crash into the Fort's territory. The count went up by seconds.",,1580374150,{},ffzdw9p,False,t3_ew010z,False,True,t3_ew010z,/r/history/comments/ew010z/things_that_went_right_for_the_germans_in_world/ffzdw9p/,1580374151,1,True,False,history,t5_2qh53,0,,,

Stalin was reluctant to amass combat-ready troops at the border, because it could be seen as a preparation for attacking Germany. USSR already did not have a much better reputation than Nazi Germany at the time, so it was not clear that UK and USA would side with USSR in this war. In the end the final true date came too late, and most of the Soviet troops were caught by the invasion while in transit, heading towards the border.

6. The dispute between generals (who also had different opinions among themselves) and Stalin was not about falling or not falling back, but rather about when and how to fall back to minimize losses. The decision that they made turned out to be wrong because Germans, having the initiative, caused the situation to change very quickly, and Soviets did not manage to re-evaluate their plans on falling back and get Stalin’s approval fast enough (i.e. they did get Stalin’s approval, but it was too late).",,1580373789,{},ffzdn2y,False,t3_ew010z,False,True,t1_ffz51wm,/r/history/comments/ew010z/things_that_went_right_for_the_germans_in_world/ffzdn2y/,1580373790,1,True,False,history,t5_2qh53,0,,,

He can't keep Spain pacified without personally being there and he can't be there because he has to be elsewhere and while it's not pacified he has to leave a large chunk of his army there.

And the same is true of Italy and everywhere else.

And that's **before** the disaster of the Russian invasion.

There is just never any chance that Napoleon can hold that much territory against the will of the people occupying it. He just doesn't have the infrastructure in place to do it and he can't put that infrastructure in place in time.

Britain isn't ever going to go bankrupt because they're buying from and selling too the entire rest of the world at this point.

There's never any chance that Napoleon can invade them either.

The only viable path for the empire is to consolidate and stabilise and the continental system actively works against those goals.

Ultimately arguing that environment means phenotype isn't genetically deterministic applies equally to the 'genetic analysis' argument as to if we cloned someone.

They took over Paris, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria-Hungary (who ""voted"" but was bullied into joining Germany as one sovereign state). Other countries such as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania (I believe). I'm sure there's others I'm leaving out.

In my opinion, Hitler's drug use greatly influenced the future of the world as he seemed to make countless awful decisions after this time period. Basically every move he made regarding the Soviet Union was absolutely asinine. Unthinkable that he would let his soldiers and commanders rot in Stalingrad for months and months when that battle was so clearly lost and the only food around were rats in the decimated city.

As for luck? I'm not sure but I suppose the fact that everyone allowed Hitler to go unchecked in the 1930's as he built up his army and Luftwaffe.

168,[],,Peacheserratica,,,[],,,,text,t2_o6tlnek,False,False,[],"There has absolutely been a Eurocentric focus for many, many years.   


In the Middle East we had people like Ḥasan Ibn al-Haytham, an Arab mathematician, astronomer, and physicist who lived from the years A.D.965 – A.D.1040 and is considered one of the founders of modern optics. We had Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi, who dentified the fever as part of the body’s defence, and was the first to  describe the symptoms and pathology of smallpox and measles (A.D.865 – A.D.920). There was Nasir Al-Din al-Tusi, a Persian polymath, architect, philosopher, physician, scientist, and theologian. He is often considered the creator of trigonometry as a mathematical discipline in its own right. He also authored the *Treasury of Astronomy, a surprisingly* accurate table of planetary movements that reformed the existing planetary model of Roman astronomer Ptolemy (A.D.1201 – A.D.1274**)**.  


Then in Asia we had people inventing world-changing things, like compasses, gunpowder, paper making, and printing, and used these inventions for hundreds of years before Europeans ever heard about them. A man named Bì Shēng (A.D.990 - A.D.1051) was a Chinese artisan and inventor of the world's first movable type technology, nearly 600 years before Johannes Gutenberg created his printing press.  


So when you wonder if science, and how it's taught, has a Eurocentric bias, consider what you were taught about the inventor of printing, because it certainly wasn't Gutenberg, even though many Western schools teach that it was him.  


Eurocentrism also shows up in many other ways, far too many to mention. But I can talk about my own field, which is archaeology. Now of course Europeans weren't the first people ion earth to ever find an old bone or arrowhead, but when it comes to archaeology as a scientific pursuit, that was absolutely defined by Europeans, and really exploded in popularity as various European nations began to seriously colonize other places, like India, Africa, the Americas, Egypt, etc.   


In the beginning, archaeology was really more of a hobby enjoyed by rich European men who didn't need to work a job to get by, so they traveled the world and had adventures and slept with ""exotic"" native women, as well as enjoying finding and bringing home interesting old artifacts they found on their journeys. Before long word spread in many areas that rich white guys would pay good money for things like mummies, fancy old pottery, old jewelry, stuff like that. it was also becoming popular to kind of present this is a quest to learn about the past by digging it up.  


unfortunately, the men doing this digging (or paying other people to dig, really) were going into it with the assumption that white Christian Europeans are the peak of human evolution, that they are the most intelligent, that  god meant for them to rule the world, blah blah blah, so as they were exploring and excavating, they were looking at the artifacts and ancient sites through this bias.   


Another issue is that back in the early days, there really were no rules or guidelines or code of ethics governing how an excavation should be carried out. These days we have to document every stage, dig carefully, document before we move artifacts, be sure not to damage things as we go, all while making sure to respect and comply with any laws or regulations about how we must respond if we find something like human bones, AND while respecting any local indigenous people who might have any interest in or connection to the site. But back in the day it was more like ""Hey guys lets open this wall with dynamite!! Don't mind those native kids over there, it's their own fault if they don't get out of the way of the blast, LOL"". They also didn't see anything wrong with going to another country, finding a thing, and saying ""Oh cool, I own this now"" with no regard to the rights or wants of the locals.   


So anyway, for a long time archaeology was a science for the entertainment and enlightenment of white men. Eventually they started allowing women to be archaeologists (white women only). Among the first to be recognized as a real archaeologist was Dorothy Annie Elizabeth Garrod, which doesn't mean she was the first woman to ever DO archaeology, only among the first to be recognized by the establishment. And I can assure you, there are still male archaeologists out there who insist that women have no business doing science, but fortunately they're gradually dying out.   


And it wasn't until the 20th century, if I remember right, that it started to occur to people that, hey, maybe indigenous people could actually be allowed to study their own history! Because before then, due to the Eurocentric/racist beliefs that so many lived by, it was ridiculous to think some ""dirty native"" could do science, because obviously they are just savages who can't understand complex things. But turns out that people who are not white Europeans are just as capable of making science happen as anyone else.   


In fact these ""white people only"" beliefs persisted for so long that it wasn't until 1930 that the first female Native American archaeologist, Bertha Parker,  was recognized as a real archaeologist. In fact she led the Gypsum Cave Expedition, which ended up providing what was, at the time, the oldest evidence of human occupation in North America.   


Anyway, I could go on for ages, but yes, there has been a great deal of Eurocentrism in how we do and teach science. Of course what you learn in school will vary depending on what country or state you're in, whether or not it's a religious school, and other factors, overall we do tend to teach much more about the discoveries and advances of white European men than anyone else, and assumptions about race have definitely shaped how certain sciences have evolved, and how information has been accepted or rejected.",,1580358722,{},ffyyv5g,False,t3_evkj5r,False,True,t3_evkj5r,/r/history/comments/evkj5r/does_the_history_of_science_have_a_eurocentric/ffyyv5g/,1580358723,1,True,False,history,t5_2qh53,0,,,

A lot of the early industrial technologies, like railroads, didn't work so well in tropical locations for a long time.  Tropical disease may also have been a factor, keeping the population young and creating a lottery for attaining old age and ability.  A lot of what Brazil has to offer now is something that had to be invented out of the raw materials of Brazil and didn't have an immediate or obvious use.  The geographic position wasn't that good either to begin with, as it was pretty well out of the way of main trade routes, and only on the Atlantic.

Slavery may have been an issue, it lasting longer in Brazil. 

 I am probably mistaken, but the Portuguese may have been to blame as well.  Britain treated the USA as a trade partner and for the most part connived at its early success as opposed to how the Spanish basically used their lands as a source of materials with little effort to develop them beyond what was needed for extraction, did the Portuguese do the same?

It's not nearly as severe now, since we have antibiotics that usually wipe out the infection if the person is treated quickly, but the plague has never completely disappeared.   


And the plague never even came close to wiping out all humans. The Black Death never reached the Americas, so there are several million people who were never affected by that specific plague.

1) it’s a place you can place a garrison or supplies during an invasion. An enemy army in a foreign region has a shelf-life usually. If they cannot forage successfully, maintain a supply line, or successfully raid stores then they will eventually withdraw or disband. So you might lose a town but if you can save supplies in a place that can’t be raided the enemy might leave or you might be able to wait for support if it is available.

2) a smaller fort blocking or near a road might be more effective than a fortified town. There are stories of armies achieving amazing feats by going through rough terrain. However, usually armies rely on roads. A fort on a road to a town can pose several problems. One the army might lose too many soldiers trying to destroy it and need to withdraw. Two, if they bypass it they may leave their flank exposed to its garrison in a future siege or fight while approaching the town. Three, the fort could cut their supply lines if they bypass it as well and leave them vulnerable in future conflicts. 

All my understanding comes down to is that an army will usually have to deal with a fort sooner rather than later if they want to remain in a region and it is an easy way to potentially choke an army with relatively minimal forces.",,1580349597,{},ffylzcu,False,t3_evwbht,False,True,t3_evwbht,/r/history/comments/evwbht/how_forts_outside_of_the_city_could_protect_it/ffylzcu/,1580349598,1,True,False,history,t5_2qh53,0,,,

There were waves of plague across Europe for centuries but they did get much less serious at some point. Note that there was a plague outbreak in San Francisco starting in 1900 and there are still isolated cases and outbreaks. We now treat it with antibiotics.

There are theories for why the plague died down. One is that the population of rats changed. One species replaced another and lived in less proximity to humans. Since rats and their fleas carried the disease, this would have reduced human infection. But the dates don't quite match. Another theory is that humans evolved some resistance. But good luck proving that. Changes in living conditions may have contributed. But basically, no one knows for certain.

If an invasion comes, the local army and garrison might be able to match it. In that case, the castle being just nearby is enough to give protection the city. If the invasion is completely unmatchable, than the city might get torched but the military and some residents can whole up in the castle and be a nuisance, forcing the invaders to commit to a siege. If the siege gets lifted, they come out and rebuild with the human and material resources they managed to save.

After gunpowder, forts were often built at strategic locations surrounding cities, with city walls replaced by rings of individual forts. These could extend out in the country side.

Canaris promptly spent the whole time telling Franco that he should, under no circumstances, join the war because Germany would lose. At the time, France had just fallen and Britain hadn't recovered, so an attack on Gibraltar was feasible. Canaris, however, consistently downplayed the viability of such a move. 

You could say that this was simply Canaris giving Franco some very legitimately good advice, but he was quite literally doing the exact opposite of his job. Franco certainly favored the Axis ideologically, but he also knew that losing trade with the US was a huge ask, even during that brief window when it looked like Hitler might win. Canaris consistently encouraged him to ask for more out of Hitler than Hitler would ever give though, so it's pretty comical and significant in terms of how the war played out.

The DDR started out as the Soviet zone of post-WWII Germany. Germany was essentially split up — most of the eastern part was given to Poland, except the northern part of East Prussia, which became Russia’s Kaliningrad Oblast. The Saarland was given to France (and later returned to West Germany in the 50s). The rest was divided up into occupation zones, with the US, UK, France, and USSR each controlling part of what was left (ie the borders of modern Germany). 

The Western powers and Soviets couldn’t come to an agreement on what exactly to do with Germany, and as the Cold War got tense there was no real incentive to do so. The result is that Germany wound up divided into two countries. West Germany became sort of like Europe’s Japan, heavily subsidized by the Western powers and dedicated to eliminating the aspects of German culture that allowed the rise of the Nazis, while East Germany was... more complicated.

There was definitely some substantial Russian influence on East German culture, and it became more intense as it became increasingly obvious that scientists, intellectuals, and skilled laborers wanted to be basically anywhere else in the world, to which the DDR responded by building the Berlin Wall and inner German border fortifications. But the real issue is that both NATO and the Warsaw Pact were aware that the two most strategic invasion routes for a possible WWIII were through the Germanys, either the North German plains or through an area in Hesse and Thuringen called the Fulda Gap. (The latter was considered so important that SHAEF, the European version of the Pentagon was located nearby in Frankfurt.) 

Here’s where we get to the meat of the answer. Everyone knew that if the balloon went up, the front lines would be in Germany. As a result, the DDR had a particularly close relationship with Moscow, and the DDR’s armed forces, rather than getting export versions of Soviet weapon systems as the other Warsaw Pact countries got, received the real, full spec hardware — planes, tanks, you name it, East Germany got the heavy duty stuff same as back in Moscow. (And a lot of that materiel wound up in the US after reunification. As you might guess from Putin’s foreign policy, that was somewhat humiliating for Russia.)

Brazil (and most Latin American countries, I am from Mexico) has a culture centered on family loyalty.

Another problem is the culture of cheating and corruption. Yes there is a ton of corruption and cheating in the USA and in China, but in Latin America it is so intertwined with the culture that corruption at all levels is accepted and sometimes encouraged.

A particular example would be Hanau, where he used them while still advancing, essentially doing the equivalent of a drive-by shooting.

\-He always had a good idea of his strength and those of his ennemy. He calculated the distance of the reinforcements, studied the character of ennemy and allied generals, inspected the battle ground, knew where to put his cannons to stop a charge or support an assault...

As we hope you can appreciate, the Holocaust can be a fraught subject to deal with. While don't want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the /r/History mods have created this brief overview. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.

##What Was the Holocaust?
The Holocaust refers to the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.

##But This Guy Says Otherwise! 
Unfortunately, there is a small, but vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as ""Revisionists"", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *""entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.""*

It is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.

##So What Are the Basics?  
Beginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.
First only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler’s approval.

The early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. 

By early 1942, the ""Final Solution"" to the so-called ""Jewish Question"" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.

Construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  ""Reinhard"" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Chełmno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.

##The Camps  
There were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as ""extermination through labor"". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and ""allowed"" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.

Although some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.

The Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Bełżec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.

Several camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.

##How Do We Know?  
Running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz.

Thirdly, consider that many, if not most, of the earliest European universities were created by clergymen/the church to teach theology (among other subjects).

Welcome to **/r/History**!

This post is getting rather popular, so here is a friendly reminder for people who may not know about our rules.

**We ask that your comments contribute and be on topic.** One of the most heard complaints about default subreddits is the fact that the comment section has a considerable amount of jokes, puns and other off topic comments, which drown out meaningful discussion. Which is why we ask this, because /r/History is dedicated to knowledge about a certain subject with an emphasis on discussion.

We have a few more rules, which you can see in the sidebar.

Thank you!

From what I’ve read, the show does a very very good job in getting things accurate considering it’s a docudrama at the end of the day. To be honest I’m kind of surprised how much it got right. 

Nevertheless there is one glaring error near the start with both the Narrator and Murad II saying that Constantinople was never taken by an army. This is false as it was captured by the Crusaders during the Fourth Crusade.

As we hope you can appreciate, the Holocaust can be a fraught subject to deal with. While don't want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the /r/History mods have created this brief overview. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.

##What Was the Holocaust?
The Holocaust refers to the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.

##But This Guy Says Otherwise! 
Unfortunately, there is a small, but vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as ""Revisionists"", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *""entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.""*

It is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.

##So What Are the Basics?  
Beginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.
First only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler’s approval.

The early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. 

By early 1942, the ""Final Solution"" to the so-called ""Jewish Question"" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.

Construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  ""Reinhard"" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Chełmno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.

##The Camps  
There were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as ""extermination through labor"". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and ""allowed"" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.

Although some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.

The Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Bełżec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.

Several camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.

##How Do We Know?  
Running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz. Below you'll find a short list of excellent works that should help to introduce you to various aspects of Holocaust study.

That being said, I do know some about physiology and biochemistry, and cloning Lola would definitely not bring about studying these changes. First of all it would never be approved by an ethics board but let's not think about that and disregard all ethical reasons against this. Now lets list the ways in which cloning her would tell us almost nothing about heritable changes between then and now: 

1.human development begins in the womb - would her surrogate share the same lifestyle and have the same nutrients that she might've had? Almost definitely not. It's unsustainable to put a surrogate through similar situations as Lola would've gone through, so she wouldn't have been able to be ""a clone of herself"" anyways as early as the womb.

2. Diet and lifestyle of Lola would most certainly be significantly different 5k years ago than today. Given the way agriculture and the ecology of the earth has changed, it would be almost impossible to recreate the environment in which Lola would've spent her formative growing years, the years which cause the most changes in her physiology. 

3. The human body is colonized by all kinds of bacteria, and these bacteria are also no doubt different from ones which would've inhabited her body 5k years ago. 

There's loads more reasons why cloning Lola would essentially be a scientific waste of time biologically speaking, and would not at all ""highlight incremental heritable changes"" like you're referring to.

The war of 1812, whatever the stated offence causing it on the US side was still a loss.

Britain, on the other hand, just wanted the US to stop as we had other, far more important issues to deal with... and stop you did after some ultimately futile flexing on both sides. 

The endlessly acclaimed victory at New Orleans, used in so many debates as a ""yeah but, this battle..."" attempt at oneupmanship was just as much a sop as the reasons for war. It meant little as the war was already over and would've meant less for American fortunes had the war gone on. One battle does not an overall victory make, especially not when your capitol is still smouldering, your enemy can attack your lands from the sea at will, and most of his people don't even know (or care) that they're at war with you... all while being a major player and bankrolling their allies in the greatest conflict for half a millennia.  

The truth (and difference) is, for all its talk America wasn't above opportunism, hypocrisy, low blows or decrying something on one hand while having a slice of the same cake with the other.

And when it comes to the topic of migrations so many articles are politicized to a ridicious level so I can't recommend those either.

I'd reccommend Eupedia but not everything on that website is correct, but about 80% is. I basically informed myself mostly through research papers regarding genetics and archaeology.

Japan simply did not have enough boats to move 100k+ troops over to Korea in one go.

Other than the battle of Sekigahara, which was after Hideyoshi's death, I can't think of a single field battle where Hideyoshi or Nobunaga used more than ~50k troops, although obviously the total size of their army was larger, and you often saw larger forces during sieges (e.g. 170k at the siege of Odawara). Even at Sekigahara, it was actually about 80k troops that took the field on either side - looking at peak strength for both sides is misleading because it double counts daimyo who switched sides.

That's largely consistent with what we see in the invasion of Korea, in which the total size of the invasion force peaked at around 160k but a given field battle usually had at most 40-50k troops (e.g. 40k in Byeokjegwan). 

&gt;Hideyoshi never had the full support of all Daimyos. Tokugawa, for example, never sent a single soldier to support this invasion.

While this is true to some extent, the Daimyo of Japan were far more committed to supporting Hideyoshi than Ming China was to supporting Korea. The Ming were able to field around 200,000 soldiers in a single battle at Lake Poyang. Even after they collapsed, the usurper Shun dynasty was able to field nearly 100,000 men at the battle of Shanhai Pass. By contrast, the entire Ming expeditiary force peaked at 70-90k men and was under 50k for most of the first wave.",,1580304799,{},ffwllae,False,t3_euzvm0,False,True,t1_ffwhgvz,/r/history/comments/euzvm0/would_it_be_wrong_to_say_that_at_the_battle_of/ffwllae/,1580304800,1,True,False,history,t5_2qh53,0,,,

It set sail for the Arctic in 1836, that time just by herself, and promptly got stuck for the winter, and she wouldn't get out until 10 months later. 

The absurdity comes mostly from the ice being extremely unkind. It got pushed over 10 meters up a cliff at one point, collided with an iceberg and suffered a few leaks as a result of ice crushing the hull. At some point, they applied boat chains across the hull to keep the entire thing together whilst planning to sail her back out to the Atlantic--all whilst the ice was carrying them merrily through several straits to the east. Once the ice allowed them again to move freely, they were still stuck to ice floes, one of which eventually dropped off which caused the ship to start leaning heavily to the other side and nearly sinking her (again), until they got it all hacked off. 

Despite the sinking ship, Back's memoir says all the officers were in agreement that they should sail home (boat chain held together ship and all) and they eventually beached the Terror in Ireland, where they somehow managed to salvage it enough to rebuild it, now made sturdier for Antarctic (James Clark Ross) and Arctic (John Franklin) duty.

In the case of China, part of the issue is that they didn't really need to trade with distant empires the way Europe did. They were one of the most developed countries in the world at the time, and their principal interaction with their neighbors was their offering tribute. Europe's drive for exploration and trade was mostly about trying to gain access to China's riches (as well as spices from elsewhere in Asia), and one of their ongoing problems was that they just didn't have anything China wanted. It was only when the Spanish discovered tons of silver in the new world that trade started to really form, followed by the British deciding become drug dealers. China did do a lot of trade throughout all of this, and receive foreign guests. There were just complications- trade going through pirate middlemen off the coast instead of official channels, diplomatic confusion as western and chinese protocols clashed, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

For Japan, who were by far the more isolated nation, the policy of ""sakoku"" was more politically motivated. It was enacted shortly after the end of their warring states period, and the country had just gone through three different ruling dynasties very quickly. In this period of instability, you had weirdo foreigners from Spain or Portugal going around and converting people to some weirdo cult where they made everyone pledge allegiance to some weirdo called the pope instead of their local daimyo, the shogun, or the emperor. This seemed really dangerous, and in fact when some regions tried to crack down on this weirdo ""Christian"" cult they wound up with a huge rebellion that was backed by some of those foreigners.

It had domestic political reasoning as well. Those foreigners didn't really care who they traded with. They would happily trade a bunch of top-of-the-line rifles and cannons to a local lord, who might then use it to rise up against the Tokugawa shogunate. Strictly banning foreign trade was a way to try to cut the power of potential rivals who might try to enact a coup or rebellion.",,1580298537,{},ffwf0pt,False,t3_esapdu,False,True,t3_esapdu,/r/history/comments/esapdu/why_did_east_asia_turn_into_a_long_period_of/ffwf0pt/,1580298538,1,True,False,history,t5_2qh53,0,,,

Wars having very clear bad guys are more rare than you'd expect, and they're not always who you'd expect. In the case of WWI, it wasn't really fought for any sort of ideological reason, and there wasn't really a clear aggressor. Every country generally didn't want to go to war, and every country had a vocal minority that advocated for war, a sentiment that was common-ish then but got a lot less so after the world wars. Many have pushed forward that point that a man in the trenches generally had much more in common with the man he was shooting at in the opposite trench than either did with the officers and government that were forcing them to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

In the case of Germany, it's a bit of a mixed bag. The start of WWI was a series of dominoes. Germany kind of wound up making the biggest jump, but that was less out of aggression or ill will so much as it was them being in a hard place strategically. They tend to get a bit more of the blame pinned on them for this, but it also tends to get amplified by the lingering effects of Allied propaganda that wanted to impress that they won the war, that they were in the right, and it wasn't a white peace or anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Germany's problem, pre-war, was that France and Russia were allied. If a war broke out, they would have to fight on two fronts, and they didn't think that they could win a war on two fronts. The solution they came up with was to try to quickly win on one front, then turn around and take their time fighting on the other front. Since Russia was very big and very slow to mobilize their army, and Paris was comparatively close to the border, it made sense for them to plan to beat France first.

&amp;#x200B;

They constructed an extremely detailed, German-engineered plan on how to quickly move all their troops and advance into France with the aim of knocking them out of the war in the few weeks that it would take Russia to get their troops to the front lines. They dealt with the issue of heavy defenses on the French border by going around them through Belgium. They didn't have any beef with Belgium, they just wanted to pass through, but the Belgians and their friends the British didn't see it that way.

&amp;#x200B;

So in the run up to the war when Austria-Hungary was beefing with Serbia over Franz Ferdinand, Russia announced that they were going to partially mobilize just in case. They didn't see this as going to war so much as it was being ready in case a war broke out, but it set alarms off in Germany. Their plan was timed extremely closely and relied on launching before the Russians could mobilize. If the Russians were moving they needed every second, so they launched their attack.

&amp;#x200B;

So from the perspective of the Allies, it looks like there's this worrying situation going on in eastern Europe, but everyone's hoping it won't turn into more than a small regional conflict, when suddenly Germany launches a massive invasion of France while violating the sovereignty of neutral Belgium. It looks crazy and aggressive (and their brutal actions in occupied French and Belgium lands later in the war didn't help their image), but from a German perspective it's them being forced to make a hard decision- and ultimately not having that decision pay off.

&amp;#x200B;

It was the same thing with a lot of their tactics. Unrestricted Submarine Warfare was created due to their not being confident in their ability to beat the British fleet on the surface. Treaties were broken to use weapons like gas because their initial strategy of quickly beating France had failed. The operation depicted in 1917 may have seemed like a fiendish trap to the British, but to the Germans was a controversial retreat whose main purpose was to shorten their lines to deal with the heavy losses they'd received at the Somme.

&amp;#x200B;

From a global perspective, there wasn't much difference between them, and if anything, the British, French, and Belgians were committing more crimes worldwide in their colonies than the Germans, who as a comparatively young nation didn't have many possessions abroad.

1) Geography. France, England, Spain and the Dutch all have geography on their side. England, France and Spain(apart with Portugal) have natural borders without a lot of big internal dividing areas. The Dutch have this partially, the Dutch heartland of Holland, Zeeland and Utrecht have natural borders(big rivers) and are the same geographical speaking.  

2) A great national struggle for independence. The Spaniards against the Muslims, the Dutch against the spaniards, the French and English against eachother. These countries had great wars for their independence(England more to conquer, but it was still a defining war) in which people united against their common enemy and emphasised the things that bound them. 

3) Yes nationalism as we knew it began in the 19th century: However there was in England, France and Spain already a form of proto-nationalism from these great wars. People(read the elite) saw some things as inherentely English/Dutch/French/Spanish. This allowed these groups to continue seeing other countries as other and thus continue defining their national identity. 

Italy and Germany didnt have these thing. Germany doesnt have big national borders, didnt have a unifying struggle against an opressor/enemy and while people defined German as a unique group, this was in the way some people call themselves Europeans. Yeah we all have a lot in common, but also a lot of differences and wouldnt want to be in 1 country. In the 19th century with Napoleon the idea of nationstates emerged and German intellectuals began talking that actually Germany should be 1 country. 

Italy is a bit different: Yes it has clear geographical boundries, but it didnt have(until the 19th century) the big national struggle, nor a unifying idea of a nation(again untill 19th century). Also, Italy had Austria-Hungary, Spain and France fighting over  it, menaning these powers didnt allow it to unite. Finally, Italy had a lot of developed cities, which developed their own identity and proto-nationalism which worked against unification.

Russia is weird, cause it doesnt have any of these things, yet developes its own culture and proto-nationalism very very quickly.

Napoleon, even since his first campaign in Italy - acted and fought like a sovereign. Everything he did, he did on his own terms.

The incompetent officers, those who would cause strife or rivalry, he got rid of them. He was about to made decisions on the fly. He didn't have any to answer to, he could do whatever he wanted. He had very few political constraints that any general would.

This is contrast to say the Archduke Charles, who was constantly undermined the Austrian Emperor and the Aulic Council (1809); the Russian generals constantly fighting and bickering amongst themselves (always); Karl Mack von Leiberich and Archduke Ferdinand (1805).

He was a soldier-king just like Gustavus Adolphus and Frederich the Great - the one thing he had over them, was that his military was new and there was no entrenchment of noble old men, there was no baggage.

Now, Napoleon on the field. Strategy?

Napoleon's art of war wasn't dominated by the strategic level - his strategy was simple: big battle with lots of artillery -&gt; take capital -&gt; win (maybe one more battle, if needed).

[This is why he focused on Moscow in 1812 and Berlin in 1813, to his own detriment.]

Napoleon's art of was dominated by the operation level. He had the ability to made fast immediate decisions based on how he saw the situation evolving, exploiting any weakness he could see. 

[This type of centralized command and micromanagement is why he lost the war in Spain - he was giving order from Paris]

1. The previous unifications were because of marriages, power struggles etc. Both German and Italian unification came to be, at least partially, because of strong nationalism. That is a big difference with the other countries.   

2. The position in Europe. The other countries, Spain, England, Netherlands, Russia (France less so) are on the edges of the continent. Modern day Germany and Italy were divided in spheres of influence by the other countries therefore unable to unify.  

3. In the case of Italy we have to go through enlightenment etc. for people to at least consider practically abolishing the Papal State.

1. He was the worst workaholic you'll ever meet. He rarely slept over three hours a night and knew literally to the regiment who the officers were, where they were supposed to be and where they had to go. This obviously allowed him a great deal of control over his armies.  

2. Concentration of troops on vital points. One of the things Napoleon was absolutely ridiculously good at was calculating where the enemy would be in X days and make sure his troops arrived on exactly the right time at the right location. In battle he almost always instinctively knew where to concentrate his troops to break the enemy.  

3. Inspiring his troops. Napoleon knew of most soldiers where they'd fought and what they did there. He was familiar with his soldiers (as in informal) which made him extremely loved and because he usually won, his soldiers usually felt invincible.  

4. He recognized the power of a modern nation state of which France basically was the first. Not only did this mean that he had more soldiers through conscription, it also meant that the soldiers had a stronger incentive to fight. Napoleon promoted soldiers for bravery, not where they came from. Unfortunately though, Napoleon focussed a bit to much on bravery and not neccessarily commanding skill. Still better than allowing the aristocracy to purchase commissions.  

5. He had an incredibly able staff around him. Davout was arguably one of the greatest commanders of his time. Berthier was an insanely capable chief of staff. Ney was one of the bravest soldiers of his time and the list goes on. Oh his stepson, Eugene de Beauharnais was a great commander too.  

6. He was young and innovative in battle tactics. He was able to constantly do what his enemy didn't expect.

&amp;#x200B;

Some points of critique:

1. Napoleon did almost nothing in innovating technology. In 1812 the French artillery was probably the most dated among the Great Powers in Europe.  

2. Illness, not something he can necessarily help, but he was sick often towards the end of his career. He was sick at the battles of Borodino and Waterloo for example.  

3. Like stated before, promoting people for bravery, not necessarily for commanding skill.

830,[],,FeanorwasaDouche,,,[],,,,text,t2_2gga5jrl,False,False,[],"The purpose of identifying individual ships was for military intelligence.  For example, it was known before the war that the USN had the Saratoga, Enterprise, and Lexington in the Pacific.  If you then learn that the USN has transferred the Yorktown to the Pacific during the war, and read a report that the Yorktown was sunk, you can estimate that the Pacific Fleet will not receive any reinforcements in the form of carriers for a significant amount of time and only contains the original three.  

Knowing which type of carrier was sunk is also very important.  The Yorktown-class carriers were arguably the best carriers in the world at the beginning of the war, knowing if you sank a Yorktown-class carrier or the vastly inferior Wasp-class carrier is important to strategic planning, you need to know what you are, or might be, up against.

As for identifying the individual ship itself, that's not really useful, it was more done based on estimation and prior-gained intelligence.  If you intercept a message that the USS Lexington is going to be ferrying aircraft to Hawaii and you torpedo a Lexington-class carrier between California and Hawaii, you can assume you torpedoed the USS Lexington.  Similarly, if you then torpedo a Lexington-class ship in the Coral Sea, you can assume it was the Saratoga because the Lexington was sunk off the coast of California.  This then tells you that the USA doesn't have any Lexington-class carriers left, which is important when judging subsequent operations as the Lexington-class carriers were quite good and operated very large air groups.  Combined with knowledge that the Wasp is still in the Atlantic, and you have only three American fleet carriers you have to worry about and you know that they're all Yorktown-class carriers.

Of course, the flaw in this is that it's hilariously inaccurate.  The number of times the Japanese 'sank' the USS Lexington is remarkable.  In some cases this could be simply that if the Japanese saw a Lexington-class carrier, they assumed it was the Lexington.  Actually identifying which ship you sank would be entirely done based on existing intelligence of which ships were in the area and which ships of the class had already been sunk, there was no effective way to identify one ship from another when in a submarine, with the possible exception being the USS Hornet, which wore a unique paint-scheme until she was sunk in October of 1942.  From the air identifying the specific carrier might be possible if you recognize and remember the number painted on the deck of the carrier and then associate that with the USN naming convention, but that's difficult.

On the whole, identifying which ship by name was sunk was not important.  Identifying the class of ship was important due to the vastly different strengths of different classes of ships, so knowing which enemy ships have been sunk or are simply in the enemy fleet is crucial to make strategic and tactical decisions based on what the enemy fleet composition is expected to be.",,1580276556,{},ffvxrfe,False,t3_evfpzo,False,False,t3_evfpzo,/r/history/comments/evfpzo/often_in_ww2_naval_reports_one_nation_will_report/ffvxrfe/,1580279509,1,True,False,history,t5_2qh53,0,,,

After two months the Tonquin was ready to set sail for their return leg of their journey. But before turning for home, they would make the most of the opportunity to trade with the locals for furs. They left the Columbia &amp; sailed up to Vancouver Island &amp; made anchor at Clayoquot Sound.

Their local guide &amp; translator, Joseachal of the Quinault had family among the local Tla-o-qui-aht band of the Nootka people.

Joseachal took some of the fur traders to shore to negotiate long term contracts with the chief. Meanwhile, when word got out that a ship was in the sound &amp; looking to trade, many Tla-o-qui-aht traders came out to meet them with their sea otter pelts. Onboard, a respected elder, Nookamis would speak for &amp; negotiate prices for the Tla-o-qui-aht. He &amp; Thorn, working through signs &amp; the trade lingo began to haggle over the trade price for the furs. Nookamis wanted five blankets per pelt, a price far higher then Thorn was expecting. They argued back &amp; fourth, thorn getting more &amp; more frustrated; finally he just snapped. Thorn grabbed one of the otter pelts &amp; slapped Nookamis in the face with it, then ordered all of the natives off the ship. Deeply shocked &amp; offended the Tla-o-qui-aht packed up their furs &amp; returned to shore.

On returning from shore &amp; hearing what Thorn had done Joseachal said they should all leave immediately. The Tla-o-qui-aht already had a shaky relationship with white traders &amp; they surely would retaliate for such a blatant insult. But Thorn replied that he had things under control and he would not “run before a lot of naked redskins.”

A few days later the Tla-o-qui-aht returned, offering to trade their furs; this time lead by their chief, Wickaninnish. Now they said they would take three blankets &amp; a knife for each man. This seems a price Thorn was willing to accept. The Tla-o-qui-aht traders were welcomed back on board &amp; goods began to quickly change hands. Soon more men arrived to trade, and more canoes began to pull along the ship.

The men were milling about on deck, and more &amp; more of the Natives were coming on board. Something didn’t sit right with the crew of the Tonquin. Maybe it was the large number of natives, maybe it was the way they were spreading out across the ship, but something was wrong. Thorn ordered his men to begin preparing the ship to leave.

When Wickaninnish saw the sailors climbing the rigging he gave his signal. At once the all the Tla-o-qui-aht men drew their newly traded knives &amp; attacked the crew.

A fierce &amp; bloody fight ensued. Thorn had ordered the weapons stored below deck, so most of the crew was unarmed. Joseachal was spared, taken back to shore under the protection of his family. But the rest of the men on board were clubbed &amp; stabbed. One man was stabbed &amp; fell below deck, injured but alive. Four men, up in the ship’s rigging could not be reached, and used the system of ropes to move above the attackers &amp; find a hatch below decks.

The five men, mow below decks got to the weapons &amp; made a desperate last stand, firing the muskets &amp; cannons, fending off the warriors. But the rest of the crew was killed.

As night fell the Tla-o-qui-aht left the ship. The survivors on ship conferred on what they would do. Four of them were still able to fight or flee, but the fifth, James Lewis, was too injured to go anywhere. It was decided the four able men would take the rowboat &amp; try and escape south. Under cover of darkness they slipped away, leaving Lewis to his fate.

Though he could not fight, or run, Lewis decided he would not go down easily. The Tla-o-qui-aht returned in the morning to loot the ship. They approached cautiously, wary of the ship’s cannons. Lewis appeared on deck &amp; made signs that he wasn’t going to fight anymore. Canoes full of Tla-o-qui-aht men pulled alongside the ship, and the men began ransacking the ship and looting the valuable trade goods. Meanwhile Lewis had went below deck, he waited until they were all on board, and lit a fuse leading to the powder stores. The ship erupted in a blinding column of fire, splintering the ship, killing hundreds on board &amp; in the surrounding canoes. As bits of broken ship, canoes &amp; bodies rained down, the shattered hull sank to the bottom.

The survivors that had managed to sneak away in the night tried to work their way south back to the fort at Astoria, but a storm blew them to shore. They were soon captured by the Nootka and handed over to the Tla-o-qui-aht. As revenge for the explosion that had killed their people, the Tla-o-qui-aht tortured the four sailors to death.",,1580276104,{},ffvx9zw,False,t3_evfb8v,False,True,t1_ffvx94u,/r/history/comments/evfb8v/which_are_the_bestmost_incredibleunbelievable/ffvx9zw/,1580279285,1,True,False,history,t5_2qh53,0,,,

For the next two months the passengers refused to talk to the captain, they conversed among themselves in French or Scots. But everyone’s mood soon improved as they neared Hawaii; everyone it seems, except for Thorn.

The crew &amp; passengers delighted in the warm welcome by the native Hawaiians, touring the island seeing the place where Captain Cook had been killed, and traded for fresh food &amp; souvenirs to take home. But Thorn Stayed on board, writing notes home complaining that the locals were savage &amp; dirty &amp; were have a terrible influence on his crew. When they were set to sail for another island, it was found three of the crew had jumped ship. Thorn ordered the Hawaiians to hand them over. The three men were brought forward. One was confined below decks, one was flogged, &amp; the other was locked in irons. Why each man got a different punishment is not clear.

The Tonquin sailed to the next island so they could meet with King Kamehameha, to negotiate for some pigs to bring with them to the new colony, &amp; to see if they could get some of the Hawaiians to come with them to man the fort. Negotiations went well &amp; soon the Tonquin was ready to sail with fresh livestock &amp; 24 additional men to help run the ship &amp; start the colony. But as the ship was preparing to leave it was found one man was missing, he had missed the last boat back. He soon turned up in a Hawaiian canoe, but as the boat approached the Tonquin, Captain Thorn told the sailor he was no longer welcome on board. When the boat pulled alongside &amp; the sailor tried to climb aboard, Captain Thorn jumped into the canoe, grabbed a stalk of sugar cane, beat the man senseless &amp; pushed him into the water.

The Hawaiian boatmen quickly dove in &amp; rescued the sailor &amp; rowed him back to the Tonquin. This time keeping at a distance the man asked to be allowed back on board. Thorn refused; the sailor’s belongings were tossed overboard, and he was paddled back to the island. As the Tonquin sailed away, the man yelled out that he was an American citizen, he knew his rights, &amp; if he ever saw Thorn again he was a dead man.

The Tonquin headed away from the Islands &amp; continued on its way, across the Pacific, arriving at the mouth of the Columbia River. As they approached the mouth of the river they encountered the fearsome Columbia Bar. This was where the outflow of the river meets the ocean currents; huge waves are a near constant, shifting sand bars conceal the main channel. Even under ideal conditions it takes a skilled pilot to safely navigate the hazards. When the Tonquin approached the Bar the seas were raging. Waves as big as buildings were crashing against the shallows. Captain Thorn Ordered his First Mate, Mr. Fox &amp; four men to approach the bar in a longboat to check the depts. &amp; find the main channel. Fox looked out on the roiling sea &amp; said it would be impossible. Thorn turned on him &amp; shouted, “Mr. Fox, if you are afraid of water, you should have remained at Boston.” Several of the passengers questioned the wisdom of sending the small boat into such dangerous waters, but the captain could not be dissuaded.

The men rowed the little boat out disappearing behind the waves only to pop up again. But soon all on the Tonquin lost sight of the boat. The crew remained on station all day, hoping to catch sight of the longboat returning, but it was never seen again.

The next day Second Mate Mumford &amp; some of the passengers volunteered to take the pinnace out to search for the missing crewmen. But as the small boat approached the breakers they were nearly sucked in &amp; smashed, they tried finding their way around the breakers, but had to retreat back to the Tonquin. Thorn repositioned the ship to where the charts said the channel should be, but there was still no clear way in. He ordered Mumford to take the pinnace out to find the channel. Mumford once again picked his way through the breakers &amp; checking the depth as they went, but again was soon driven back to the ship.

Thorn, displeased with Mumford’s performance, now ordered Third Mate Atiken to man the boat &amp; find the channel. He was to raise a flag when he found the way through. Atiken piloted the small boat back into the bar, and in time a flag was seen between the waves. Thorn ordered the Tonquin to weigh anchor &amp; follow the pinnace through the shoals. As the ship began under way, Atiken turned his boat about &amp; began to make his way back. But as the two vessels approached it became clear something was very wrong. The Tonquin, driven by the constant wind was making good speed, the pinnace, caught in the river channel, was being dragged at a good speed in the opposite direction. As the two passed, everyone on deck began call out to the captain; “The boat, the boat!” They yelled for the captain to haul in the sails, slow the ship, or the boat would over shoot them. Thorn is reported to have coolly replied, “I can give them no assistance.” The crew watched in horror as the small boat passed them by &amp; was dragged out into the open ocean.

The Tonquin continued into the bar, fighting the currents, fighting the winds, there were several times that it looked like the ship would be wrecked. They drifted into the breakers near shore, waves broke over deck, they crashed into sand bars, at one point the wind died leaving then stranded in the roiling waters. But slowly they worked their way through to the other side.

Meanwhile Aitken &amp; the four other men on the pinnace were in worse trouble. The strong tide dragged them far from shore, a huge wave sent it toppling into the sea. Aitken &amp; another man were washed away from the boat &amp; soon drown. But Stephen Weeks and two Hawaiian boatmen men were able to right the boat and climb on board; an incredible feat given the freezing water &amp; rough seas. Weeks manned the oars all night keeping the small craft from getting too close to sore &amp; breaking on the rocks. During the night one of the Hawaiian men died, by morning the other was near death from hypothermia. Weeks managed to keep the boat off the rocks until dawn, &amp; with the daylight was able to guide it to shore. He left the surviving boatman burred in some leaves &amp; trudged his way towards the mouth of the river to find the Tonquin.",,1580276080,{},ffvx94u,False,t3_evfb8v,False,True,t1_ffvx7e1,/r/history/comments/evfb8v/which_are_the_bestmost_incredibleunbelievable/ffvx94u/,1580279275,1,True,False,history,t5_2qh53,0,,,

The Voyage of the [Tonquin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonquin_(1807))

 In the early 1800’s J.J. Aster was setting up a business venture. He would fund the construction of a fort at the mouth of the Columbia to service the lucrative fur trade between the Pacific Northwest &amp; China. To get the fort going he contracted a crew of experienced Canadian, Scottish &amp; American fur traders, clerks, &amp; builders to sail from New York around Cape Horn &amp; up to the Columbia. He purchased a top of the line ship, the Tonquin, which had already sailed to China &amp; back &amp; proven itself capable of withstanding the worsts of sea &amp; storm. And to Captain the ship, Lieutenant Jonathan Thorn, hero of the Barbary Wars. The expedition couldn’t have been outfitted better.

It began to fall apart just hours into their 6 month trip.

Thorn turned out to be a strict disciplinarian. To quote one of the fur traders on board, “the captain, in his frantic fits of passion, was capable of going any lengths, and would rather have destroyed the expedition, the ship, and everyone on board, than be thwarted in what he considered as ship discipline, or his nautical duties.”

Thorn had assigned the senior passengers to the more luxurious aft cabins. But he had assigned the junior clerks &amp; the craftsmen to the cramped crew quarters before the mast. The passengers began to argue that they should all be quartered together. They were shareholders with the company &amp; the company owned the ship, so by rights they owned the ship &amp; should be allowed to bunk wherever they pleased. Thorn flew into a rage &amp; said he was the captain &amp; would straight up kill anyone who countermanded his orders on his ship. It was only the timely intervention of one of the elder traders that calmed things down &amp; preventing violence.

The ship sailed on, the crew working to keep the ship operating, the passengers drawing up plans for how they would build &amp; man their fort, and Thorn quietly stewing &amp; writing letters home about how undisciplined &amp; lazy everyone was.

Running low on fresh water, the ship made landfall at the Falkland Islands. They stayed for a week, collecting water, making repairs to the ship, etc. While the crew was busy working on the ship, the passengers decided to explore the island &amp; do a little bird hunting. On the 7th day on the island the captain came ashore to join in the bird hunting. The party worked their way along the hills &amp; shore until they spied a plump gray goose. They let the captain take the first shot. He drew down &amp; fired. The goose fluttered, but didn’t move. Thorn fired a second time, but the goose didn’t move. They all ran up to the goose &amp; found a dead goose propped up &amp; tied in place; one of the passengers having left it as a prank. The hunting party burst out laughing, all except Captain Thorn.

Thorn marched back to one of the two landing boats &amp; ordered the men to take him back to the ship. The rest of the men on shore went about their business, hunting, exploring, &amp; having a good time. Then one of them looked up &amp; saw the Tonquin, under full sail &amp; quickly heading out to sea. At first the men on shore thought it must be a prank, the Captain getting them back for the goose. Surely, at any moment the sails would luff &amp; the ship would turn around. But gradually it became apparent the ship wasn’t turning, this wasn’t a prank; Captain Thorn was sailing away leaving the 8 men stranded.

The 8 castaways piled into the remaining rowboat &amp; began chasing after the ship. Surely, they told themselves, the ship would stop any moment, let them catch up; Thorn had made his point. But the ship sailed out of the natural harbor &amp; out into the open sea pulling further away. The men in the rowboat desperately followed after, into the open sea, battered by wind &amp; wave, knowing if they returned to the barren islands it would mean a slow death from exposure.

On board the Tonquin the crew was murmuring about what the captain was doing, but dutifully following orders. Eventually word reached the remaining passengers that part of their party was being left behind on orders of the Captain. Robert Stuart, the nephew of one of the men that had been left behind, confronted Thorn. He drew both his pistols &amp; demanded the captain turn the ship around, saying if he refused ""You are a dead man this instant”.

842,[],,airborngrmp,,,[],,,,text,t2_8g81u,False,False,[],"This is a hugely oversimplified view of Russian warfare and a misunderstanding of European warfare during the Napoleonic and Modern Eras. For starters, during the French Revolution the National Convention enacted the Levee en Masse where military service became compulsory to all able bodied men aged 18-25 (the first of its kind, which was also expanded many times throughout the Napoleonic Era). This allowed the *French* to field huge armies capable of using column tactics to rupture enemy lines (a tactic known for causing many friendly casualties due to the massing of men many ranks deep to take advantage of the mass of fighting men), and essentially disregard casualties due to the expansion of the available manpower:

&gt;“You cannot stop me; I spend 30,000 lives a month.”
          -Napoleon Bonaparte

It took years and defeats for the Empires and Monarchies of Europe to see the need to arm and train a national army to defeat Napoleon at his own game. The effective generals of Austria (Archduke Charles), Russia (Generals Suvorov and Kutuzov) and Prussia (General Blucher) advocated this course throughout the early coalitions against Revolutionary France, but the crowned heads resisted the idea of arming and training peasants and serfs on a large scale for fear of future insurrection along the lines of the very revolution they fought against. 

The Coalition Allies fought the early Napoleonic Era campaigns using limited conscription, a small guard of professional soldiers mostly comprised of upper class and petit nobilité and mercenaries. Meanwhile, France fielded a huge, homogenous national army with an officer corps consisting of officers promoted largely on merit rather than family name and connections, and a revolutionary Corps de Armee organizational system that allowed a flexibility to such a huge mass of fighting men that the outdated monarchies were completely unable to match in the early fighting. They instead relied on rigid linear tactics and cumbersome command of joint forces, which time and again fell to The Grande Armee's speed, decisiveness of attack and Napoleon's brilliant strategies.

The Russians would eventually field a comparable force, and once they did so were able to match the French (although not necessarily Napoleon himself; he was still incredibly difficult to defeat even in 1813) in tactics and battlefield skill, and were officered by fully competent and capable generals. The fact that in earlier battles they had a learning curve that necessitated flinging the manpower they had against forces better positioned, using superior firepower and maneuver tactics doesn't mean that Russian (or Prussian or Austrian) leadership was necessarily lacking, but rather that Napoleon was playing a different game, and they had to learn the rules before playing to win.

Although I won't delve too deeply into this particular point, Russia similarly learned the lessons of modern warfare the hard way by trading bodies, territory and materiel to the Germans in WWII before finding a functional organization and doctrine that could decisively crush the Nazi forces invading their country. During that war, a large proportion of the most adept practitioners of mobile warfare on any side of the war were Russian. From the Autumn of 1943 to the end of the invasion of Manchuria, Russian arms swept all before them, and had arguably the most seasoned, best led (and unquestionably the largest) armored force in history. Russia has a rich history of being a slow starter when it comes to warfare, but the notion that they have not fielded expert leaders throughout the modern era is nonsense.",,1580274881,{},ffvvxrq,False,t3_ev5zlr,False,False,t1_ffvmewc,/r/history/comments/ev5zlr/why_is_battle_of_austerlitz_always_considered_as/ffvvxrq/,1580278654,1,True,False,history,t5_2qh53,0,,,

They thought resistance would be light, but they knew it'd be there.

However, the US didn't plan on annexing Canada.

The Madison administration saw the occupation of Canada as their best bargaining chip, something they could use to bring Great Britain to the negotiating table and force them to end the impressment of US merchant sailors - the major war aim.

The idea was to swiftly &amp; easily seize Canada, then turn around and force Britain to respect US maritime rights in exchange for its return. Of course things did not work out like that.

Strategically, Napoleon used the capabilities of a fairly modern nation state (Revolutionary France is the first one in Europe) to raise and support vast armies of conscripted citizen-soldiers, the “nation in arms”

Remember that in monarchist states, the &gt;last&lt; thing a ruler generally wants to do is arm their people.

Napoleon recognized that France was a new kind of state, and the citizen-soldier was a new kind of soldier. This allowed him to do things with his army (breaking it up on the march, soldiers live off the land, etc) that greatly increased its speed, and enabled his tactical success. (This is an incredibly brief summation, there’s a lot to this)

Tactically, he was really good at forcing a single decisive battle through cross country maneuver (largely due to the above) and beating the enemy army so bad that they went straight to the peace table. See Marengo or Austerlitz. “Decisive Battle” was like the crack cocaine of military theorists for like a century and a half after Napoleon.

There’s also stuff like the “central position” tactic, which Napoleon used a lot. He was also famed for his use of artillery, using a concentrated “grand battery” to really help blow a hole in enemy lines for his infantry to exploit.

There’s over 60 battles that Napoleon fights, and he wins almost all of them.

Napoleon was outnumbered and running low on supplies while facing two armies just waiting for him. He could fight or he could retreat - if he retreated the superior number and attrition would have destroyed him in the long run. So he decided to fight.

Napoleon made himself appear more disadvantaged than he was, which convinced the allies that they could give battle and beat him. Masterstroke 1.

Napoleon made the Russians do what he wanted and he held off the bulk of their troops at Telnitz until the 3rd corps could arrive. Masterstroke 2.

This weakened the center significantly which allowed for an assault on what was very ""unfavorable ground"". Masterstroke 3.

It is historically very rare that a frontal assault on the center to be successful, because this is where the opposing forces are strongest. Usually it ends in disaster just like Pickett's Charge. What makes this even more interesting is that the centre was on ""high ground"".

Now, what is he telling lies about?

&gt; **Most Russians hadn't fought in a generation** and their cannons were missing by hundreds of yards.

Russia was at war with the Ottoman Empire all the time.

Russia participated in wars against France semi-successfully.

Russians semi-successfully fought the Frencha few days before Austerlitz at Hollabrunn.

&gt; which allowed Russia to easily replace their loses and eventually defeat Napoleon in Russia

Very silly imaginations - armies are destroyed all rebuilt all the time. Look at France after the Russian Invasion, Austria and Prussia rebuilding their armies, etc.

I have an imaginary counterpoint - destruction of the Russian army and long term piece with them would mean that there would be no immediate war with Prussia, which allows time for reform and time for Austrians to rebuild, together they destroy Napoleon in 1809.


&gt; Napoleon's failure at Austerlitz cost him the Napoleonic Wars.

The battle that ended the Holy Roman Empire and started the Confederation of the Rhine was in no way a failure.

Austerlitz strengthened Napoleon's hold on France and increased his legitimacy as a monarch substantially.

American sources tend to be favourable to Napoleon - the British are not, aside from drooling sycophants like Andrew Roberts.",,1580270010,{},ffvpwtu,False,t3_ev5zlr,False,False,t1_ffvh63d,/r/history/comments/ev5zlr/why_is_battle_of_austerlitz_always_considered_as/ffvpwtu/,1580275764,1,True,False,history,t5_2qh53,0,,,1580270251.0

The French also claimed that the Russians tried to retreat across a frozen lake, which was broken by French guns causing a mass drowning. This was another lie. The lake was drained days later and they found only a couple bodies.

Napoleon was hoping to completely destroy the green Russian Army. The Russians didn't send enough of their forces down from the hill, like Napoleon wanted. So he hoped that if he attacked the Russian center with surprise he could rout them. However they place he attacked was defended by the only good quality troops in the Russian army; the nobles who for a while bloodily drove the French back.

Where the French and Russian sources agree is that Russian gunnery was absurdly terrible. Most Russians hadn't fought in a generation and their cannons were missing by hundreds of yards. At the same time Napoleon had the most crack army Europe had ever seen. Napoleon getting bogged down in the center probably cost him the opportunity to encircle the Russians which allowed Russia to easily replace their loses and eventually defeat Napoleon in Russia. Napoleon's failure at Austerlitz cost him the Napoleonic Wars.
